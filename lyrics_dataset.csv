Obituary,Metal,Death Metal,Mahbod Moghadam: An Obituary,"Mahbod Moghadam, the brilliant and unconventional co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, passed away in March at age 41, resulting from complications from a recurring brain tumor. A pioneering internet entrepreneur known for his outsized personality and bold vision, Moghadam left an indelible mark on how we engage with and understand online content.Born on November 17, 1982, to an Iranian Jewish family, Moghadam grew up in Encino, California. He graduated from Yale University magna cum laude in 2004 with a history and international studies degree and he received a Fulbright Scholar to France in 2005. After earning a J.D. from Stanford Law School in 2008, Moghadam began his career as an attorney.In 2009, Moghadam co-founded Rap Genius (later renamed Genius) with Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory. As the site's earliest and most prolific contributor, Moghadam helped establish Genius' irreverent voice and community-driven approach to annotating lyrics and text. Though sometimes controversial, his humorous, self-aware style was integral to Genius' early growth and popularity.Moghadam's entrepreneurial journey continued with the founding of Everipedia in 2015 with Sam Kazemian and Theodor Forselius. As Chief Community Officer, he worked to build a more inclusive, accessible online encyclopedia. His hands-on approach and tireless promotion of the site embodied his commitment to democratizing knowledge.A man of many talents, Moghadam was also an accomplished pianist with a lifelong passion for music spanning from hip-hop to classical. He was fluent in Persian, French, Arabic, and English. As an angel investor, he supported innovative startups like Coinbase and Flexport, demonstrating his keen eye for potential and his desire to foster the next generation of disruptive technologies.Throughout his career, Moghadam remained an iconoclast, unafraid to speak his mind or challenge conventions. His freewheeling attitude and penchant for provocation sometimes led to controversy, but they were also inextricable from the passion and innovative spirit that drove his success.Moghadam's legacy is one of fearless innovation and the empowerment of online communities to engage with and share knowledge on their own terms. As he once said, ""The only way to succeed is if all you're doing is working on your own company."" He lived those words, pouring his singular energy into the platforms he helped create.Though he faced significant challenges, including major health issues, Moghadam never lost his drive or his faith in the internet's transformative power. His impact on how we experience the web will endure, inspiring new generations of entrepreneurs and users to push boundaries and think differently."

Eyes That Witnessed Madness]In an age crucified by the nails of faithWhen rank scarecrows of christ blighted landsAn aloof Countess born an obsidian wraithDared the abyss knowing well She was damnedHer life whispered grief like a funeral marchTwisted and yearning, obsessed and entrancedWith those succumbing to crueltyCrushed 'neath the gait of Her danceA whirlwind of fire that swept through the briersOf sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped...She demanded the Heavens and forever to gleanThe elixir of Youth from the pureWhilst Her lesbian fantasiesReamed to extremesO'er decades unleashedCame for blood's silken cureBut Her reign ended swiftlyFor Dark Gods dreamt too deepTo heed Her pleasWhen Her gaolers were assailedWith condemnations from a priestWho'd stammered ritesIn the dead of nightFor maidens staining winding sheetsAnd She postured proudWhen Her crimes were trowelledAnd jezebelled to peasant lipsThough She smelt the firesThat licked limbs higherTo the tortured cunts of accomplicesSo ends this twisted fable's worthAnd though spared the pyre's biteBy dint of nobled bloodlined birthHer sins (crimes) garnered Her no respiteForever severed from the thrill of coming nightWhere slow Death alone could grant Her flight""The Spirits have all but fled judgementI rot, alone, insaneWhere the forest whispers puce laments for meFrom amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbaneBeyond these walls, wherein condemnedTo the gloom of an austere tombI pace with feral madness sentThrough the pale beams of a guiltless moonWho, bereft of necrologies, thusCommands creation over the earthWhilst I resign my lips to deathA slow cold kiss that chides rebirthThough one last wish is bequeathed by fateMy beauty shalt wilt, unseenSave for twin black eyes that shalt come to takeMy soul to peace or Hell for company""(To peace or hell for company)My soul to Hell for company"

Emperor,Metal,Black Metal,BBF3,"Interviewer: Well... Where are you coming from?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: (pause) Well... I don't like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and, erm... that's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem. The government... the American government - they're sneaky, they're very deceitful, they're liars, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government is one-- is one systematic government that... that nobody can trust. I don't trust them myselfInterviewer: And how long have you been writing for?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Huh?Interviewer: How long have you been writing for?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Since I was fourInterviewer: Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do open-mics, absolutelyInterviewer: What kind of reactions do you usually get?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Usually, people are... are pretty much in agreement with what I'm sayingInterviewer: We overheard you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding ticket?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: That's accurateInterviewer: right. Do you wanna tell us that story?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... ""Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody,"" I said. I says... ""I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour."" I says ""I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket... and I'm here to... to get my fines out of the way and get the fuck to work."" The judge says ""You can't talk like that in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court."" Then I said... I told the judge, ""If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you."" I said ""Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen."" I said ""I'm not gonna take your shit."" I said ""I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket like I said."" I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25 dollars and I says ""Here's my money, now I am leaving."" And I left it at thatThen, before I left, I turned around and told the judge ""I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you."" I said ""If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would."" And the judge says ""Yeah, you have a point,"" He goes ""You don't need to get loud,"" I said ""Don't get loud?"" I says ""I've got every right to get loud."" I says ""You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it. You think you're god because you have a robe and you can put people up the goddamn river for 20 years? Well you're not."" And I left it at thatInterviewer: Did you walk away?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes I did. I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this country's government. I just don't like it, because... they're sneaky, like I said - they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, they rip the people off. That's the American government for you. America is a third world country, and people don't recognise it... and I think that that's pretty god damn sad, that they don't recognise their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slum[Instrumental]Interviewer: Well... Do you have any weapons?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, I do. I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle...Interviewer: Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: No way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse. Like I said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it standsInterviewer: What do you think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even got a mind that's that...that inhumaneInterviewer: are you ready for what's coming?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Ready as I'll ever beInterviewer: Most people aren'tBlaise Bailey Finnegan III: There's a little saying... Dates back for generations...Interviewer: Go on...Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of itInterviewer: Would you mind reciting your poem for us?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Not at all, I don't see why... I don't see why I couldn'tThere's an evil virus that's threatening mankindIt's not state of the art, it's a serious state of the mindThe muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced eliteA menace to society, a social diseaseTo brainwash the mind is a social disorderThe cynics, the apathy one-upmanship orderWatching beginnings of social decayGloating and sneering at life's disarrayEating away at your own self esteemPouncing on every word that you might be sayingTo attack someone's mind is a social disorderThe constitution, the government, martial law orderSuperficially smiling a shake of the handAs soon as your back is turned treason is plannedWhen every good thing's laid to restBy the governments hate, by the constitution and their liesAnd every time you think you're safeAnd when you go to turn awayYou know they're sharpening all their knivesAll in your mindAll in your headTry to relate itAll in your mindAll in your headTry to escape itWithout a conscience they destroyAnd that's a thing that they enjoyThey're a sickness that's in all of our mindsThey want to sink the ship and leaveThe way they laugh at you and meYou know it happens all the timeBut it only happens in your mindThe rats in the cellar you know who you are...Or do you?Watching beginnings of social decayInterviewer: Thank you for your time[Instrumental]"
Immortal,Metal,Black Metal,Dance with the Devil,"[Part I: Dance with the Devil][Verse 1]I once knew a nigga whose real name was WilliamHis primary concern was makin' a millionBein' the illest hustler that the world ever seenHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreamsA corrupted young mind at the age of 13Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiendShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was soberHer son's heart simultaneously grew colderHe started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projectsCheckin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospectsHe was fascinated by material objectsBut he understood money never bought respectHe built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and stealBut got locked once and didn't hesitate to squealSo criminals he chilled with didn't think he was realYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equalI don't project my insecurities on other peopleHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needlesAnd so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evilA feeble-minded young man with infinite potentialThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mentalCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weedDancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleedBut he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed[Chorus]Everyone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequencesYou probably only did a month for minor offensesAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chanceBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advanceDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell blockBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rockDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the topThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot[Verse 2]So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could doTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crewStartin' fights over little shit up on the blockStepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rockWorkin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spotHit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaineFulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brainTired of the block niggas treatin' him the sameHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugsBut when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no loveThey told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugsAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugsAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a BloodEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the clubBut only a real thug can stab someone 'til they dieStandin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyesBilly realized that these men were well-guardedAnd they wanted to test him before business startedSuggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-heartedSo now he had a choice between goin' back to his lifeOr makin' money with made men up in the cyph'His dreams about cars and ice made him agreeA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to beAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three[Chorus]Everyone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequencesYou probably only did a month for minor offensesAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chanceBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advanceDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell blockBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rockDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the topThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot[Verse 3]They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainmentUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin' aloneThree in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way homeAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed herWalkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed herThey wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hairAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody thereShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairsThey got to the roof and then held her down on the groundScreamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!""The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawedSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jawThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silentlyAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violentlyBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turnRippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burnedHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concernedWhen they were done and she was layin'Bloody, broken and bruisedOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone throughAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crewHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically deadAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head[Bridge]I'm fallin' and I can't turn backI'm fallin' and I can't turn back[Verse 4]Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her lifeHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and iceAnd he felt strong standin' along with his new brothersCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt coverBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own motherShe looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken herShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin' herHis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplateHis corruption had successfully changed his fateAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home lateWorkin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?He turned away from the woman that had once given him birthAnd cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scaredBut only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't thereAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and coldAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soulThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt itAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about itAnd listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom tooAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I goIn fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my showsAnd every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flowHe could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't knowThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wickedWhite, brown, yellow and black — color is not restrictedYou have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflictedAnd you'll be one of God's children that fell from the topThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting potSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say neverBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever[Part II: ""I""][Intro: Immortal Technique]Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' backInto the grace of God and comin' after youY’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shitYour fuckin' A & R ain’t shitI’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo dealYo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off![Verse 1: Diabolic]Go ‘head and grip GlocksI’ll snap your trigger finger in six spotsYou’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shotsI’ll watch you topple flatPut away your rings and holla backCan’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle capsBeneath the surfaceI’m overheatin' your receiving circuitsBy unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churchesWhat you preach is worthlessYour worship defeat the purposeLike President Bush takin' bullets for the secret serviceBeyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'emShow no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasmTour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dickIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fistDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plagueFist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenadeSo if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm meI’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an armyStorm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a missionTo split your body into a billion one-celled organismsImmortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitchYou’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifixI’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chipsArsenic language transmitted revolutionarilyI’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitablyChemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome pieceI’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s nieceI’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' meAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphyThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychologySo you’re nothin', like diversity without equalityAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythologyUsin' numerology to count the people I sent to

contemplate marriage withFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hireDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desireFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer LopezEveryone told me, kickin' it to her was hopelessAt first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kidsThe thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kidsBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would sayEveryone around the way gave up tryin' to get in itIt didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with itOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit itTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did itCause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit itAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dickSmokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit itShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copyBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppyShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pureI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure[Hook: Jean Grae]Don't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all plannedI'm blessed just to know youI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all nightCan't find a reason whyGod came between you and IAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you goHold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sadI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was gladThat I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in itSo every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minuteI didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hoursOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowersThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby showerWe talked about power to the people and suchWe spent more time together, but it was never enoughI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feelI was too interested in keepin' it realPerfectly honest and completeShe would always call me ""cariño"" and never TechniqueBought me a new book to read every two or three weeksForever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speakIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaksShe convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streetsTo stop robbin' and stealin' from people like youInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx ZooMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan tooGot to the point when I was either with her or my crewSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was trueI couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fearsBut honey's only response was a face full of tearsShe could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tightI tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sightI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the lightExcept I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night[Hook: Jean Grae]Don't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all plannedI'm blessed just to know youI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all

life, college and my careerEnded up locked up like an animal for a yearWhere the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseerThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was nearAt night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see herHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappearedJust an empty cell until the state gave me paroleIn the summer, came back, intact and on trackBut the fact of the matter is I still felt coldEven after my mother hugged me, cryin' at homeMy real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zoneFuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt aloneRelatively well-known around the New York undergroundBut I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be downThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hairThough gone physically, somehow it was still thereI had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bearSo I went and visited the building where she used to liveThe world looks a lot different after you do a bidThe way your life done changedWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same gameLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaineStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last nameHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughtaBut her facial expression changedWhen I asked about her daughter[Hook: Jean Grae]Don't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all plannedI'm blessed

you never know[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behindAnd she had left it there waitin' for such a long timeI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up firstI saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursedShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worstReversed my position, stepped over and opened the doorAnd sure enough there was an envelopeWith my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,"" is what the letter said""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be deadBut when you left in '97, a part of me went to HeavenI thank God at least I got to know what love really wasBut it hurt me to see what true love really does‘Cause even though we never made loveYou were all that there wasIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leaveYou made me doubt the way I thoughtYou made me want to believeAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to meIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to meThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to beBaby, don't you see?I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIVHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to youI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but youPromise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitablyNo matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.""What happened for the rest of the day is still a blurBut I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of herShe was buried on August 3rdThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with peopleHold the person that you love closely if they're next to youThe one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with youAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond‘Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone"

Paradise Lost,Metal,Doom Metal,"Paradise Lost, Book 1","THE ARGUMENTThis first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac't: Then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. Which action past over, the Poem hasts into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, describ'd here, not in the Center (for Heaven and Earth may be suppos'd as yet not made, certainly not yet accurst) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest call'd Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of thir miserable fall. Satan awakens all his Legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief Leaders nam'd, according to the Idols known afterwards in Canaan and the Countries adjoyning. To these Satan directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created, according to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven; for that Angels were long before this visible Creation, was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the truth of this Prophesie, and what to determin thereon he refers to a full Councel. What his Associates thence attempt. Pandemonium the Palace of Satan rises, suddenly built out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in Councel.   Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the World, and all our woe,With loss of EDEN, till one greater ManRestore us, and regain the blissful Seat,Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret topOf OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspireThat Shepherd who first taught the chosen Seed,In the Beginning how the Heavens and EarthRose out of CHAOS: or, if Sion hillDelight thee more, and SILOA'S brook that flowedFast by the Oracle Of God, I thenceInvoke thy aid to my adventurous song,That with no middle flight intends to soarAbove th' Aonian mount, while it pursuesThings unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost preferBefore all Temples th' upright heart and pure,Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the firstWast present, and, with mighty wings outspreadDove-like sat'st brooding on the vast AbyssAnd mad'st it pregnant: What in me is darkIllumine, what is low raise and support;That, to the height of this great ArgumentI may assert th' Eternal Providence,And justify the ways of God to men.  Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy viewNor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what causeMov'd our Grand Parents, in that happy state,Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator, and transgress his WillFor one restraint, Lords of the World besides?Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guileStirred up with Envy and Revenge, deceivedThe Mother of Mankind, what time his PrideHad cast him out from Heav'n, with all his HostOf Rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiringTo set himself in Glory above his Peers,He trusted to have equal'd the most High,If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aimAgainst the Throne and Monarchy of GodRais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battle proudWith vain attempt.  Him the Almighty PowerHurled headlong flaming from th' Ethereal SkyWith hideous ruin and combustion, downTo bottomless perdition, there to dwellIn Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to Arms.Nine times the space that measures day and nightTo mortal men, he, with his horrid crewLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery GulfConfounded, though immortal: But his doomReserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thoughtBoth of lost happiness and lasting painTorments him; round he throws his baleful eyesThat witness'd huge affliction and dismayMixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:At once, as far as Angels kenn, he viewsThe dismal Situation waste and wilde,A Dungeon horrible, on all sides roundAs one great Furnace flam'd; yet from those flamesNo light, but rather darkness visibleServ'd only to discover sights of woe,Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peaceAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comesThat comes to all; but torture without endStill urges, and a fiery Deluge, fedWith ever-burning Sulphur unconsume'd:Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'dFor those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'dIn utter darkness, and their portion setAs far remov'd from God and light of Heav'nAs from the Centre thrice to th' utmost Pole.Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelm'dWith Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,He soon discerns, and weltering by his sideOne next himself in power, and next in crime,Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'dBEELZEBUB. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,And thence in Heaven call'd Satan, with bold wordsBreaking the horrid silence, thus began.   If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'dFrom him who, in the happy Realms of LightCloth'd with transcendent brightness, didst outshineMyriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,And hazard in the Glorious EnterpriseJoynd with me once, now misery hath joinedIn equal ruin: into what Pit thou seestFrom what height fall'n, so much the stronger provdHe with his Thunder: and till then who knewThe force of those dire arms? yet not for thoseNor what the Potent Victor in his rageCan else inflict do I repent or change,Though chang'd in outward lustre, that fixt mindAnd high disdain, from sense of injur'd merit,That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,And to the fierce contentions brought alongInnumerable force of Spirits arm'dThat durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,His utmost power with adverse power oppos'dIn dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,And study of revenge, immortal hate,And courage never to submit or yield:And what is else not to be overcome?That Glory never shall his wrath or mightExtort from me. To bow and sue for graceWith suppliant knee, and deify his powerWho, from the terror of this arm, so lateDoubted his empire, that were low indeed,That were an ignominy and shame beneathThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of GodsAnd this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail;,Since through experience of this great eventIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,We may with more successful hope resolveTo wage by force or guile eternal WarIrreconcilable, to our grand Foe,Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joySole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.   So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.   O Prince, O Chief of many Throned PowersThat led th' imbattled Seraphim to WarUnder thy conduct, and in dreadful deedsFearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;And put to proof his high Supremacy,Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,Too well I see and rue the dire event,That with sad overthrow and foul defeatHath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty HostIn horrible destruction laid thus low,As far as Gods and Heav'nly EssencesCan Perish: for the mind and spirit remainsInvincible, and vigour soon returns,Though all our Glory extinct, and happy stateHere swallow'd up in endless misery.But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I nowOf force believe Almighty, since no lessThen such could have orepow'rd such force as ours)Have left us this our spirit and strength entireStrongly to suffer and support our pains,That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,Or do him mightier service as his thrallsBy right of War, what e're his business beHere in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;What can it the avail though yet we feelStrength undiminished, or eternal beingTo undergo eternal punishment?""Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.   Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserableDoing or Suffering: but of this be sure,To do ought good never will be our task,But ever to do ill our sole delight,As being the contrary to his high willWhom we resist. If then his ProvidenceOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,Our labour must be to pervert that end,And out of good still to find means of evil;Which ofttimes may succeed, so as perhapsShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturbHis inmost counsels from their destined aim.But see! the angry Victor hath recall'dHis Ministers of vengeance and pursuitBack to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous HailShot after us in storm, oreblown hath laidThe fiery Surge, that from the PrecipiceOf Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases nowTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,The seat of desolation, voyd of light,Save what the glimmering of these livid flamesCasts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tendFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,There rest, if any rest can harbour there,And, reassembling our afflicted Powers,Consult how we may henceforth most offendOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,How overcome this dire Calamity,What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,If not, what resolution from despare.   Thus Satan, talking to his nearest MateWith Head up-lift above the wave, and EyesThat sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besidesProne on the Flood, extended long and largeLay floating many a rood, in bulk as hugeAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,TITANIAN or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the DenBy ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beastLEVIATHAN, which God of all his worksCreated hugest that swim th' Ocean-stream:Him, haply slumbering on the NORWAY foamThe Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,With fixed Anchor in his scaly rindMoors by his side under the Lee, while NightInvests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend layChained on the burning lake; nor ever thenceHad risen, or heaved his head, but that the willAnd high permission of all-ruling HeavenLeft him at large to his own dark designs,That with reiterated crimes he mightHeap on himself damnation, while he soughtEvil to others, and enrag'd might seeHow all his malice serv'd but to bring forthInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewnOn Man by him seduc't, but on himselfTreble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.Forthwith upright he rears from off the PoolHis mighty Stature; on each hand the flamesDrivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowldIn billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.Then with expanded wings he steers his flightAloft, incumbent on the dusky AirThat felt unusual weight, till on dry LandHe lights, if it were land that ever burn'dWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;And such appear'd in hue as when the forceOf subterranean wind transports a HillTorn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd sideOf thundering AETNA, whose combustibleAnd fuelled entrails, thence conceiving Fire,Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the Winds,And leave a singed bottom all involv'dWith stench and smoke: Such resting found the soleOf unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN floodAs Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.   Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,Said then the Lost Archangel, this the seatThat we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloomFor that celestial light? Be it so, since heeWho now is Sovran can dispose and bidWhat shall be right: farthest from him is bestWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supremeAbove his equals. Farewell, happy FieldsWhere Joy for ever dwells: Hail, horrours, hailInfernal world, and thou profoundest HellReceive thy new Possessor: One who bringsA mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.The mind is its own place, and in itselfCan make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.What matter where, if I be still the same,And what I should be, all but less than heeWhom Thunder hath made greater? Here at leastWe shall be free; th' Almighty hath not builtHere for his envy, will not drive us hence:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n.But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,Th' associates and copartners of our lossLye thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,And call them not to share with us their partIn this unhappy Mansion, or once moreWith rallied Arms to try what may be yetRegaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?   So SATAN spake; and him BEELZEBUBThus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,Which, but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledgeOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oftIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edgeOf battel when it rag'd, in all assaultsTheir surest signal, they will soon resumeNew courage and revive, though now they lyeGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious hight.   He scarce had ceas't when the superior FiendWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shieldEthereal temper, massy, large, and round,Behind him cast; The broad circumferenceHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose OrbThrough Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist viewsAt Ev'ning, from the top of FESOLE,Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.His Spear, to equal which the tallest PineHewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the MastOf some great Ammiral, were but a wand,He walkt with to support uneasy stepsOver the burning Marle, not like those stepsOn Heaven's Azure, and the torrid ClimeSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;Nathless he so endur'd, till on the BeachOf that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'dHis Legions, Angel Forms, who lay entranc'tThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the BrooksIn VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shadesHigh overarch't imbow'r; or scatterd sedgeAfloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'dHath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrewBUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,While with perfidious hatred they pursu'dThe Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheldFrom the safe shore their floating CarcasesAnd broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown,Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,Under amazement of their hideous change.He call'd so loud, that all the hollow DeepOf Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,If such astonishment as this can seizeEternal spirits; Or have ye chos'n this placeAfter the toyl of Battel to reposeYour wearied vertue, for the ease you findTo slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?Or in this abject posture have ye swornTo adore the Conqueror? who now beholdsCherube and Seraph rolling in the FloodWith scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anonHis swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discernTh' advantage, and, descending tread us downThus drooping, or with linked ThunderboltsTransfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.   They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprungUpon the wing, as when men wont to watchOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.Nor did they not perceive the evil plightIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeydInnumerable. As when the potent RodOf AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evil dayWav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloudOf LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hungLike Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:So numberless were those bad Angels seenHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted SpearOf their great Sultan waving to directThir course, in even balance down they lightOn the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;A multitude, like which the populous NorthPour'd never from her frozen loyns to passRHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous SonsCame like a Deluge on the South, and spreadBeneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.Forthwith from every Squadron and each BandThe Heads and Leaders thither haste where stoodTheir great Commander—godlike Shapes, and FormsExcelling human, Princely Dignities,And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on Thrones;Though on their Names in Heav'nly Records nowBe no memorial, blotted out and ras'dBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVEGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,By falsities and lyes the greatest partOf Mankind they corrupted to forsakeGod their Creator, and th' invisibleGlory of him, that made them, to transformOft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'dWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,And Devils to adore for Deities:Then were they known to men by various Names,And various Idols through the Heathen World.Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,At their great Emperors call, as next in worthCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?The chief were those who, from the Pit of HellRoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fixTheir Seats long after next the Seat of God,Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'dAmong the Nations round, and durst abideJEHOVAH thundering out of SION, thron'dBetween the Cherubim; yea, often plac'dWithin his Sanctuary itself their Shrines,Abominations; and with cursed thingsHis holy Rites and solemn Feasts profan'd,And with their darkness durst affront his light.First MOLOCH, horrid King, besmear'd with bloodOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loudTheir childrens cries unheard, that passed through fireTo his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITEWorshipt in RABBA and her watery Plain,In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the streamOf utmost ARNON. Nor content with suchAudacious neighbourhood, the wisest heartOf SOLOMON he led by fraud to buildHis Temple right against the Temple of GodOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his GroveThe pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thenceAnd black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,From AROER to NEBO and the wildOf Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBONAnd HERONAIM, SEONS Real, beyondThe flowery Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.PEOR his other Name, when he entic'dISRAEL in SITTIM, on their march from NILETo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'dEven to that Hill of scandal, by the GroveOf MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.With these came they, who from the bordering floodOf old EUPHRATES to the Brook that partsEGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general NamesOf BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,These feminine. For Spirits when they pleaseCan either Sex assume, or both; so softAnd uncompounded is their Sssence pure,Not ti'd or manacl'd with joYnt or limb,Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,Can execute their aerie purposes,And works of love or enmity fulfil.For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsookTheir living strength, and unfrequented leftHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly downTo bestial Gods; for which their heads as lowBow'd down in Battel, sunk before the SpearOf despicable foes. With these in troopCame ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'dASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;To whose bright Image nightly by the MoonSIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,In SION also not unsung, where stoodHer Temple on th' offensive Mountain, builtBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,Beguiled by fair Idolatresses, fellTo Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'dThe SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fateIn amorous ditties all a Summers day,While smooth ADONIS from his native RockRan purple to the Sea, suppos'd with bloodOf THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-taleInfected SIONS daughters with like heat,Whose wanton passions in the sacred PorchEZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision ledHis eye survay'd the dark IdolatriesOf alienated JUDAH. Next came oneWho mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive ArkMaim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off,In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,Where he fell flat and sham'd his Worshippers:DAGON his name, Sea Monster, upward ManAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple highRear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the CoastOf PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful SeatWas fair DAMASCUS, on the fertile BanksOf ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.He also against the house of God was bold:A leper once he lost, and gain'd a King,AHAZ his sottish conqueror, whom he drewGods altar to disparage and displaceFor one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burnHis odious offerings, and adore the GodsWhom he had vanquished. After these appear'dA crew who under Names of old Renown,OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their TrainWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'dFanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seekThir wandering Gods disguis'd in brutish formsRather than human. Nor did ISRAEL scapeTh' infection, when their borrow'd Gold compos'dThe calf in OREB; and the Rebel KingDoubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,JEHOVAH, who, in one Night when he pass'dFrom EGYPT marching, equal'd with one strokeBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods.BELIAL came last, than whom a Spirit more lewdFell not from Heaven, or more gross to loveVice for itself: To him no Temple stoodOr Altar smok'd; yet who more oft than heeIn Temples and at Altars, when the PriestTurns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'dWith lust and violence the house of God.In Courts and Palaces he also ReignsAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyseOf riot ascends above their loftiest Towrs,And injury and outrage: And when NightDarkens the streets, then wander forth the sonsOf BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that nightIn GIBEAH, when the hospitable DoresYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.These were the prime in order and in might;The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue heldGods, yet confessed later than Heav'n and EarthTheir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'n first bornWith his enormous brood, and birthright seis'dBy younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVEHis own and RHEA'S Son, like measure found;So JOVE usurping reign'd: these, first in CREETAnd IDA known, thence on the Snowy topOf cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle AirTheir highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,Or in Dodona, and through all the boundsOf Doric land; or who with Saturn oldFled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.All these and more came flocking; but with looksDowncast and damp, yet such wherein appear'dObscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their chiefNot in despair, to have found themselves not lostIn loss it self; which on his count'nance castLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted prideSoon recollecting, with high words, that boreSemblance of worth not substance, gently rais'dTheir fainting courage, and dispel'd their fears.Then straight commands that at the warlike soundOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be uprearedHis mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'dAZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurldTh' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc'dShon like a Meteor streaming to the WindWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the whileSonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:At which the universal Host upsentA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyondFrighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.All in a moment through the gloom were seenTen thousand Banners rise into the AirWith Orient Colours waving: with them roseA Forest huge of Spears; and thronging HelmsAppear'd, and serried Shields in thick arrayOf depth immeasurable: Anon they moveIn perfect PHALANX to the Dorian moodOf Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'dTo height of noblest temper Hero's oldArming to Battel, and in stead of rageDeliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'dWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat,Nor wanting power to mitigate and swageWith solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chaseAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and painFrom mortal or immortal minds. Thus theyBreathing united force with fixed thoughtMov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'dThir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and nowAdvanc't in view they stand, a horrid FrontOf dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guiseOf Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,Awaiting what command thir mighty ChiefHad to impose: He through the armed FilesDarts his experienc't eye, and soon traverseThe whole Battalion views,thir order due,Thir visages and stature as of Gods,Thir number last he summs. And now his heartDistends with pride, and hardning in his strengthGlories: For never since created man,Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with theseCould merit more than that small infantryWarr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant broodOf PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'dThat fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each sideMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resoundsIn Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS SonBegirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;And all who since, Baptiz'd or InfidelJousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,DAMASCO, or MaroccoAROCCO, or TREBISOND,Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shoreWhen CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fellBy FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyondCompare of mortal prowess, yet observ'dTheir dread Commander: he, above the restIn shape and gesture proudly eminentStood like a Towr; his form had yet not lostAll her original brightness, nor appearedLess than Arch Angel ruined, and th' excessOf glory obscured: as when the sun new-risenLooks through the horizontal misty airShorn of his beams, or from behind the MoonIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight shedsOn half the Nations, and with fear of changePerplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shoneAbove them all th' Arch Angel: but his faceDeep scars of Thunder had intrenched, and careSat on his faded cheek, but under BrowesOf dauntless courage, and considerate PrideWaiting revenge: cruel his eye, but castSigns of remorse and passion, to beholdThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemnedFor ever now to have their lot in pain,Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc'tOf Heav'n, and from eternal splendours flungFor his revolt, yet faithful how they stood,Their Glory withered. As, when Heavens FireHath scath'd the Forest Oaks or Mountain Pines,With singed top their stately growth, though bareStands on the blasted heath. He now preparedTo speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bendFrom Wing to Wing, and half enclose him roundWith all his Peers: attention held them mute.Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at lastWords interwove with sighs found out their way.   O Myriads of immortal Spirits! O PowersMatchless, but with th' Almighty!—and that strifeWas not inglorious, though th' event was dire,As this place testifies, and this dire changeHateful to utter: but what power of mindForseeing or presaging, from the DepthOf knowledge past or present, could have fear'dHow such united force of Gods, how suchAs stood like these, could ever know repulse?For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,That all these puissant Legions, whose exileHath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascendSelf-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,If counsels different, or danger shun'dBy me, have lost our hopes. But he who reignsMonarch in Heav'n till then as one secureSat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,Consent or custom, and his Regal StatePut forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.Henceforth his might we know, and know our ownSo as not either to provoke, or dreadNew warR provok't:; our better part remainsTo work in close design, by fraud or guileWhat force effected not: that he no lessAt length from us may find, who overcomesBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rifeThere went a fame in Heav'n that he ere longIntended to create, and therein plantA generation, whom his choice regardShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhapsOur first eruption, thither, or elsewhere:For this Infernal Pit shall never holdCelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' AbysseLong under darkness cover. But these thoughtsFull Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,For who can think Submission? Warr then, WarrOpen or understood, must be resolv'd.   He spake: and, to confirm his words, out-flewMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighsOf mighty Cherubim; the sudden blazeFar round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'dAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm'sClash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.   There stood a Hill not far, whose grisly topBelch'd fire and rolling smoak; the rest entireShone with a glossy scurf, undoubted signThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,The work of Sulphur. Thither, wing'd with speedA numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bandsOf Pioners, with Spade and Pickaxe arm'dForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fellFrom heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughtsWere always downward bent, admiring moreThe riches of Heave'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,Than aught divine or holy else enjoy'dIn vision beatific: by him firstMen also, and by his suggestion taught,Ransack'd the Centre, and with impious handsRifl'd the bowels of thir mother EarthFor Treasures better hid. Soon had his crewOp'ned into the Hill a spacious woundAnd dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admireThat riches grow in Hell; that soil may bestDeserve the precious bane. And here let thoseWho boast in mortal things, and wondering tellOf BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,Learn how their greatest Monuments of Fame,And Strength and Art are easily outdoneBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hourWhat in an age they with incessant toilAnd hands innumerable scarce performNigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,That underneath had veins of liquid fireSluc'd from the Lake, a second multitudeWith wondrous Art founded the massy Ore,Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:A third as soon had form'd within the groundA various mould, and from the boyling cellsBy strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,As in an Organ from one blast of windTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.Anon out of the earth a Fabric hugeRose like an Exhalation, with the soundOf Dulcet Aymphonies and voices sweet,Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS roundWere set, and Doric pillars overlaidWith Golden Architrave; nor did there wantCornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,Nor great Al CAIRO such magnificenceEqual'd in all their glories, to enshrineBELUS or SERAPIS their Gods, or seatTheir Kings, when EGYPT with ASSYRIA stroveIn wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pileStood fixed her stately highth, and strait the doresOp'ning thir brazen foulds discover wideWithin, her ample spaces, o're the smoothAnd level pavement: from the arched roofPendent by suttle Magic many a rowOf Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets, fedWith Naptha and ASPHALTUS, yeilded lightAs from a sky. The hasty multitudeAdmiring enter'd, and the work some praiseAnd some the Architect: his hand was knownIn Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,Where Sceptr'd Angels held their residence,And sat as Princes, whom the supreme KingExalted to such power, and gave to rule,Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.Nor was his name unheard or unador'dIn ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN landMen call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fellFrom Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry JoveSheer o'er the crystal battlements: from mornTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eveA summer's day, and with the setting sunDropt from the zenith, like a falling starOn Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,Erring; for he with this rebellious routFell long before; nor aught availed him nowTo have built in Heav'n high towers; nor did he scapeBy all his Engins, but was headlong sentWith his industrious crew to build in hell.Mean while the winged Haralds by commandOf Sovran power, with awful CeremonyAnd Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaimA solemn Councel forthwith to be heldAt PANDAEMONIUM, the high CapitalOf Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'dFrom every Band and squared RegimentBy place or choice the worthiest; They anonWith hundreds and with thousands trooping cameAttended: all access was throng'd, the GatesAnd Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions boldWont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chairDefi'd the best of Panim chivalryTo mortal combat or career with Lance)Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As BeesIn spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,Pour forth their populous youth about the HiveIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowersFlie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,The suburb of their Straw-built Cittadel,New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and conferTheir State affairs: so thick the aerie crowdSwarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,Behold a wonder! they but now who seemedIn bigness to surpass Earth's Giant SonsNow less than smallest Dwarfs, in narrow roomThrong numberless, like that Pigmean RaceBeyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest sideOr Fountain some belated Peasant sees,Or dreams he sees, while overhead the MoonSits Arbitress, and nearer to the EarthWheels her pale course, they, on their mirth & danceIntent, with jocond Music charm his ear;At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest formsReduc'd their shapes immense, and were at large,Though without number still amidst the HallOf that infernal Court. But far withinAnd in their own dimensions like themselvesThe great Seraphic Lords and CherubimIn close recess and secret conclave sat,A thousand Demi-Gods on golden seat's,Frequent and full. After short silence thenAnd summons read, the great consult began."

for thou knowestWhat hath been warned us, what malicious foeEnvying our happiness, and of his ownDespairing, seeks to work us woe and shameBy sly assault; and somewhere nigh at handWatches, no doubt, with greedy hope to findHis wish and best advantage, us asunder;Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where eachTo other speedy aid might lend at need:Whether his first design be to withdrawOur fealty from God, or to disturbConjugal love, than which perhaps no blissEnjoyed by us excites his envy more;Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful sideThat gave thee being, still shades thee, and protectsThe wife, where danger or dishonour lurksSafest and seemliest by her husband staysWho guards her, or with her the worst endures   To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE,As one who loves, and some unkindness meetsWith sweet austere composure thus reply'd.   Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,That such an enemy we have, who seeksOur ruin, both by thee informed I learnAnd from the parting Angel over-heardAs in a shady nook I stood behindJust then returned at shut of Evening Flours.But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubtTo God or thee, because we have a foeMay tempt it, I expected not to hearHis violence thou fearest not, being suchAs we, not capable of death or painCan either not receive, or can repelHis fraud is then thy fear; which plain infersThy equal fear, that my firm faith and loveCan by his fraud be shaken or seduced;Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breastAdam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?   To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd.Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE,For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:Not diffident of thee do I dissuadeThy absence from my sight, but to avoidThe attempt itself, intended by our foeFor he who tempts, though in vain, at least aspersesThe tempted with dishonour foul; suppos'dNot incorruptible of Faith, not proffAgainst temptation: Thou thyself with scornAnd anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrongThough ineffectual found: misdeem not then,If such affront I labour to avertFrom thee alone, which on us both at onceThe enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;Or daring, first on me th' assault shall light.Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;Subtle he needs must be, who could seduceAngels; nor think superfluous other's aidI, from the influence of thy looks, receiveAccess in every Vertue; in thy sightMore wise, more watchful, stronger, if need wereOf outward strength; while shame, thou looking onShame to be overcome or over-reachtWould utmost vigour raise, and rais'd unite.Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feelWhen I am present, and thy trial chooseWith me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.   So spake domestick ADAM in his careAnd Matrimonial Love; but EVE, who thoughtLess attributed to her Faith sincere,Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.   If this be our condition, thus to dwellIn narrow circuit straitened by a foeSubtle or violent, we not enduedSingle with like defence, wherever met;How are we happy, still in fear of harm?But harm precedes not sin: only our foeTempting, affronts us with his foul esteemOf our integrity: his foul esteemSticks no dishonour on our front, but turnsFoul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feardBy us? who rather double honour gainFrom his surmise proved false; find peace withinFavour from Heaven, our witness, from the eventAnd what is faith, love, virtue, unassayedAlone, without exteriour help sustained?Let us not then suspect our happie StateLeft so imperfect by the Maker wise,As not secure to single or combin'dFrail is our happiness, if this be soAnd Eden were no Eden, thus exposed   To whom thus ADAM fervently reply'd.O Woman, best are all things as the willOf God ordaind them: His creating handNothing imperfect or deficient leftOf all that he created, much less ManOr aught that might his happy state secureSecure from outward force; within himselfThe danger lies, yet lies within his power:Against his will he can receive no harmBut God left free the will; for what obeyesReason, is free; and Reason he made right,But bid her well be ware, and still erect,Lest, by some fair-appearing good surpris'dShe dictate false; and missinform the WillTo do what God expressly hath forbid.Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoynes,That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;Since Reason not impossibly may meetSome specious object by the Foe suborn'd,And fall into deception unaware,Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.Seek not temptation then, which to avoidWere better, and most likely if from meThou sever not; Trial will come unsought.Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approveFirst thy obedience; th' other who can know,Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?But if thou think, trial unsought may findUs both securer than thus warned thou seemest,Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;Go in thy native innocence, relieOn what thou hast of virtue, summon all,For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine   So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde; but EVEPersisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.   With thy permission then, and thus forewarndChiefly by what thy own last reasoning wordsTouched only; that our trial, when least sought,May find us both perhaps far less prepar'd,The willinger I goe, nor much expectA foe so proud will first the weaker seek;So bent, the more shall shame him his repulseThus saying, from her Husbands hand her handSoft she withdrew, and, like a Wood-Nymph lightOread or Dryad, or of Delia's trainBetook her to the groves;

With tract obliqueAt first, as one who sought access, but feardTo interrupt, side-long he works his way.As when a Ship, by skilful Steersmen wroughtNigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the WindVeers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;So varied he, and of his tortuous TraineCurld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,To lure her Eye; she, busied, heard the soundOf rusling leaves, but minded not, as usedTo such disport before her through the fieldFrom every beast; more duteous at her callThen at Circean call the herd disguis'dHee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowedHis turret crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,Fawning, and licked the ground whereon she trodHis gentle dumb expression turnd at lengthThe Eye of EVE to mark his play; he, gladOf her attention gaind, with Serpent TongueOrganick, or impulse of vocal Air,His fraudulent temptation thus began.   Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhapsThou canst, who art sole Wonder! much less armThy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gazeInsatiate; I thus single;nor have fearedThy awful brow, more awful thus retir'dFairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,Thee all  living things gaze on, all things thineBy gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adoreWith ravishment beheld, there best beheldWhere universally admir'd; but hereIn this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,Beholders rude, and shallow to discerneHalf what in thee is fair, one man except,Who sees thee?

Hee leading, swiftly rolledIn tangles, and made intricate seem straightTo mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joyBright'ns his Crest; as when a wandering fireCompact of unctuous vapour, which the nightCondenses, and the cold environs roundKindled through agitation to a flameWhich oft, they say, some evil Spirit attendsHovering and blazing with delusive lightMisleads the amazed night-wanderer from his wayTo bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraudLed EVE, our credulous mMother, to the treeOf prohibition, root of all our woe;Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.   Serpent, we might have spared our coming hitherFruitless to me, though fruit be here to excessThe credit of whose virtue rest with thee;Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effectsBut of this tree we may not taste nor touch;God so commanded, and left that commandSole daughter of his voice; the rest, we liveLaw to ourselves; our reason is our law   To whom the Tempter guilefully repliedIndeed! hath God then said that of the fruitOf all these garden-trees ye shall not eatYet Lords declared of all in earth or air?   To whom thus EVE, yet sinless. Of the FruitOf each Tree in the Garden we may eate,But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidstThe Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eateThereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.   She scarse had said, though brief, when now more boldThe Tempter, but with show of Zeale and LoveTo Man, and indignation at his wrong,New part puts on; and, as to passion mov'dFluctuates disturbed, yet comely, and in actRais'd, as of some great matter to begin.As when of old some Orator renoundIn Athens or free Rome, where eloquenceFlourished, since mute! to some great cause addrest,Stood in himself collected, while each part,Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue,Sometimes in highth began, as no delayOf preface brooking, through his Zeal of Right.So standing, moving, or to highth upgrownThe Tempter all impassiond thus began.   O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,Mother of Science, Now I feel thy PowerWithin me cleere, not only to discernThings in their causes, but to trace the waysOf highest agents, deemd however wise.Queen of this Universe, doe not believeThose rigid threats of Death: ye shall not die:How should you? by the fruit? it gives you lifeTo knowledge; By the Threatener? look on mee,Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,And life more perfect have attaind than FateMeant mee, by ventring higher than my Lot.Shall that be shut to Man, which to the BeastIs open? or will God incense his ireFor such a petty Trespass, and not praiseRather your dauntless vertue, whom the painOf Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,Deterred not from achieving what might leadeTo happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evilBe real, why not known, since easier shunnd?God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:Your fear itself of death removes the fearWhy then was this forbid? Why, but to awe,Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,His worshippers; He knows that in the dayYe eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clearYet are but dim, shall perfectly be thenOpened and cleared, and ye shall be as GodsKnowing both good and evil, as they knowThat ye shall be as Gods, since I as ManInternal Man, is but proportion meet;I, of brute, human; ye, of human, GodsSo ye shall die perhaps, by putting offHuman, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,Though threat'nd, which no worse than this can bringAnd what are Gods that Man may not becomeAs they, participating God-like food?The Gods are first, and that advantage useOn our belief, that all from them proceeds,I question it, for this fair Earth I see,Warmed by the Sun, producing every kind,Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclos'dKnowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attainsWisdom without their leave? and wherein liesTh' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?What can your knowledge hurt him, or this TreeImpart against his will if all be his?Or is it envy? and can envy dwellIn heav'nly breasts? these, these, and many moreCauses import your need of this fair Fruit.Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste   He ended; and his words, replete with guileInto her heart too easy entrance won:Fixed on the Fruit she gazed, which to beholdMight tempt alone; and in her ears the soundYet rung of his persuasive words, impregnedWith reason, to her seeming, and with truth:Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and wakedAn eager appetite, raised by the smellSo savoury of that fruit, which with desireInclinable now grown to touch or tasteSolicited her longing eye; yet firstPausing a while, thus to herself she musedGreat are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruitsThough kept from man, and worthy to be admired;Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assayGave elocution to the mute, and taughtThe tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,Conceals not from us, naming thee the treeOf knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;Forbids us then to taste, but his forbiddingCommends thee more, while it infers the goodBy thee communicated, and our want:For good unknown sure is not had; or, hadAnd yet unknown, is as not had at allIn plain then, what forbids he but to knowForbids us good, forbids us to be wise?Such prohibitions bind not.

Confirmed then I resolveAdam shall share with me in bliss or woe:So dear I love him, that with him all deathsI could endure, without him live no life   So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,But first low reverence done, as to the PowerThat dwelt within, whose presence had infusedInto the plant sciential sap, derivedFrom nectar, drink of Gods.

Wake up!)Tonight, before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleepDo you question your surrender to the drop from Lover's LeapOr does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own?Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan?These waking dreams of life and deathIn the mirror are twisted and buckled;Lashes flicker, a catch of breathSkin whitening at the knucklesThe army of sleepwalkers shake their limbs and are looseAnd though I am a talker, I can phrase no excuseNot to rise againIn the chorus of the night-time I belongI, like you, must dance to that moonlight songIn the end I, too, must pay the cost of this lifeIf all is lost none is knownAnd how could we lose what we've never owned?Oh, I'd search out every knowledge that I could findUnravel all the mysteries of mindIf I only had timeIf I only had timeBut soon my time is ended, ended, ended, ended(Ended, ended)(Ended, ended)(Ended, ended)(Ended, ended)(Ended, ended)(Ended, ended)(Ended)"

The Ramones,Rock,Punk Rock,The Ramones’ “Ramones” (33 1/3 excerpt),"In  her  classic 1969 essay ""Trash, Art, and the Movies,"" Pauline Kael wrote of ""trash"" films that  when  ""you  clean  them  up, when you make movies respectable,  you kill them. The well­ spring of their art, their greatness, is in not being re­spectable.""91 While  it  could  be said  that  punk  fought long and hard against respectability,  there is no denying that the early to mid-1970s New York scene from which it emerged  was a heady mix of artists and performers. It's  almost impossible  today to imagine  a contemporary music scene  as peopled  with artists, writers, and filmmakers as the early punk move­ment  was, with  people  like Andy Warhol, William  S. Burroughs, Patti  Smith,  Mary  Harron, Arturo  Vega, Amos Poe, Ellen Willis, Gerard  Malanga,  and others  all part of the scene. As Dick Hebdige has noted, ""the New York punk bands had pieced  together from  a variety  of acknowl­edged  'artistic' sources-from  the literary  avant-garde and  the  underground cinema-a self-consciously  pro­fane and terminal  aesthetic.""92This  isn't  to suggest a calculated  effort, at least not by the Ramones,  to draw on artistic sources,  but rather that part of what made the band great was its emergence from  a vibrant  New York movement  in which distinc­tions between pop culture and art were blurred. A friend of mine always likes to point  out that British punk was more ""authentic"" than American  because it came from the working class, as opposed to the suburbs. But leaving aside the problems of this distinction (claims of authen­ticity are always tricky and a little condescending) what I think he misses in that view is that it was the very impurity  of punk-its mixing  of suburban   and  down­ town, of high art and ""stoopid,"" of camp and sincerity, of humor and violence-that made it so radical. Arguments about  purity  or authenticity of punk inevitably  end up excluding the messy, impure,  hybrid qualities that keep it sounding fresh thirty  years later.In fact, prior to his involvement in the band, Tommy Ramone  had even made avant-garde films: ""I was [get­ting] into  film-making. I guess I was jumping  around. I went  to work  for  this film company.  I was hanging around  the Museum  of Modern Art 'cause the company was right next to the Museum. I would take three-hour lunch  breaks and watch all the movies there  and I got into  avant-garde films. I started  making some stuff like that.""93 The Pop Art movement of the 195Os and 60s-of which Andy Warhol was the American  Giant-had  al­ready smashed  distinctions between  ""high"" and ""low"" culture;  by the 1970s it wasn't that what punk was doing by mixing styles was new, rather  that they had re-infused the process with a sense of fun and danger.According  to Craig Leon, most of the work with the band was completed  in seven days: ""It  took  just three days to get  the  music down,  four  for  the vocals.""94   In the  era  of  bloated,  super  group  excess, $6,400  was a paltry  amount  of money.  ""Some  albums  were  costing a half-million  dollars to make,"" Joey noted, ""and taking two or three years to record, like Fleetwood Mac ... ""95 At first, the process sounds like the ultimate do-it-your­self, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk. In  truth,   however,  the  Ramones   approached  the  re­ cording  process with a high degree of preparedness and professionalism  and a fiercely self-contained, unified sound.  But this had  not  always been  the  case. In July 1974 Tommy became the Ramones' drummer, and the band's sound  underwent a change: ""To them it was just a hobby,""  he told Punk in 1976, ""to me it was an avant­ garde thing. Then we started  getting  really good  and I said, 'This isn't  avant-garde, this is commercial!' And that's  when  I started  playing  drums.  When I saw the $signs$ ... [we] changed  the whole sound of the group into  the way it is now-you know-hard rock.""96Near  the  end  of  1974,  the  band  recorded   fifteen demos  in  one  day. These were  ""just  basic tracks  and vocals and  mixes of most  of the  songs  that  made  up their first album.""97 In September 1975 they cut the two Marty  Thau demos  (""Judy  Is a Punk""  and  ""I  Wanna Be Your  Boyfriend"").  The sound  on  the Thau demos is somewhat richer and warmer than on the other demos, and it hints at a more pop-oriented, melodic sensibility that shows how, with a slightly different  approach,  the Ramones' sound  could  be less assaultive.Although  the  band wanted  to suggest  the intensity of their live performances, the album was in no way intended to be ""live."" As Craig  Leon  notes, ""capturing the energy  of the live shows  was quite  important. But if you jump to the conclusion  that the sound  of the recording was just the sound of the band live you would be mistaken even though  that was what I was trying  to convey. The  album is quite layered and structured and took full advantage of the studio technology of its time without being obvious.""98 This tension-how to transfer the spirit of live performance without simply replicating it-was something that haunted  punk, and in some ways worked against it. For if progressive,  virtuoso  rock encouraged  deep,  repeat  listenings  and  a cultivated  appreciation for  complexity,  punk  assaulted  the  listener in a way that  almost  begged  for  a live audience.  One of the reasons punk did not move gently into the main­stream or receive more radio play was precisely because it was always about more than the music on the album: it was a stance, an attitude, that was difficult to transfer to vinyl.Yet the band, and Craig  Leon,  were determined to create  a live feel to  the  album.  ""I  actually  toyed  with the idea,"" says Leon,  ""of the recording being one long band  with  no breaks"" in a way that  would  capture  the no-break-between-songs live performances. There  are hints of this at the end of the album's second side, where ""I  Don't Wanna  Walk  Around  with You"" is followed by ""Today Your  Love,  Tomorrow the  World""  with no  break.  There were  other   experiments that  didn't happen, either, according to Leon: ""[T]here was a quad­raphonic version that I played around  with doing. I did a  lot of quad  encoded  work in  those  days and  almost did the  Ramones  album  that  way.""99   By the  time  they went into the studio  to record,  the Ramones had devel­oped  an  archive  of songs  and  had  honed  their  sound before audiences at numerous shows. ""We had the songs for  the  first  three  albums  when  we did  the first one,"" Johnny has said. ""We  already had 30 to 35 songs, and we recorded  them  in  the  chronological order  that  we wrote  them.  I didn't want  the  second  album  to  be a letdown  by picking through the best songs for the first one and using the lesser songs for the second album.""100?Before considering details of the album's production, it's worth noting how difficult it was-then, as now-for a good band to make the transition from live act to meaningful  recorded  presence. Indeed,  the pages of the underground music press in New York City in the mid-1970s are full of ads and enthusiastic write-ups for enormously popular  punk bands at the club level that subsequently  failed to  transfer  that  spirit  to vinyl. In ""The State of Pop Music in New York: A Symposium"" from the Village Voice, musician  and  record  producer  Tony Silvester noted  that the ""reason  a lot of great acts don't happen on records is because they don't feel that tension that  they feel live-9 out  of 10 times on a record  they try to duplicate  the club scene and it doesn't happen."" What's missing,  Silvester  claimed,  is ""simplicity  from the standpoint of production.""101Here  is  Craig  Leon  addressing  the  album's production:The album was recorded purely. Nothing covered up. The same way that you would record a classical or jazz work. We use the same mic placement techniques on the London Symphony Orchestra or the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra today that we used on the Ra­mones in 1976. These  techniques are the same as what you would have gotten  on classical or  jazz re­cordings or  for that matter  good  pop  recordings  in 1956. The  sound of the music in the room. Minimal effects other  than those created naturally. But it was not ""cinéma vérité"" all live and raw.We did a lot of overdubbing and double-tracked vocals, going for a bizarre emulation of the recording values of ""A Hard Day's Night."" The stereo image was inspired by that as well. Due to the limitations of 4 track recording in the 60s the image on the old Beatles records in stereo used to have the entire backing track on the left and vocals and tambourine overdubs or whatever on the right. This fit the thee-piece sound of the Ramones perfectly. There was a conventional mix of the recording but it wasn't as effective. Also, a mono mix. Some of those tracks surfaced on singles. The mono version is quite powerful....Notes...91.  Pauline Kael, ""Trash, Art, and the Movies,"" p. 115.92.  Dick Hebdige, Subculture, p. 27.93.

I did so want you to be here.You see, it doesn't matter if you catch me and send me back to the Asylum.Gordon's been driven mad. I've proved my point!I've demonstrated that even the sanest man alive can be driven to lunacy! All it takes is one bad day.That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.You had a bad day once. Am I right? I know I am. You had a bad day, and everything changed! Why else would you dress up as a flying rat?You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else! Only you won't admit it!You have to keep pretending that life makes sense. That there's some point to all this struggling. GOD you make me want to puke!I mean what is it with you? What made you what you are?Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe? Brother carved up by some mugger? Something like that I bet...something like that......something like that...happened to me, you know? I'm...I'm not exactly sure what it was. Sometimes, I remember it one way, sometimes another...if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice! Haha!My point is...my point is, I went crazy. When I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot!I admit it! So why can't you? You're not unintelligent, you must see the reality of the situation?Do you know how many times we've come close to World War III over a flock of geese on a computer screen? Do you even know what triggered the last world war? An argument with Germany over how many telegraph poles they owed their war debt creditors. Telegraph poles!It's all a joke! Anything anybody ever valued or struggled for, it's all just a monstrous, demented gag.So why can't you see the funny side?Why aren't you laughing?(Batman crashes through a mirror and attacks the Joker)Batman:Because I've heard it before...and it wasn't funny the first time.(Batman throws the Joker through another mirror.)Incidentally, I spoke to Commissioner Gordon before I came in here. He's fine. Despite all your sick, vicious little games, he's as sane as he ever was. So maybe ordinary people don't always crack. Maybe there isn't any need to crawl under a rock with all the other slimy things when trouble hits. Maybe it was just you, all the time.Joker:NO! (Joker pulls Batman's cowl down, blocking his vision and attacking him.)Batman:Don't...(Joker pulls out a gun, but when he pulls the trigger a white flag shoots out with the words CLICK CLICK CLICK)Joker:God damn it...it's empty! Well? What are you waiting for? I shot a defenseless girl, I terrorized an old man. Why don't you kick the hell out of me and get a standing ovation from the public gallery?Batman:Because I'm doing this one by the book...and because I don't want to. Do you understand? I don't want to hurt you. I don't want either of us to end up killing the other...but we're both running out of alternatives...and we both know it. Maybe it all hinges on tonight. Maybe this is our last chance to sort this bloody mess out. If you don't take it, then we're locked onto a suicide course. Both of us. To the death. It doesn't have to end like that. I don't know what it was that bent your life out of shape, but who knows? Maybe I've been there too. Maybe I can help. We could work together. I could rehabilitate you. You needn't be out there on the edge any more. You needn't be alone. We don't have to kill each other. What do you say?Joker:...No. I'm sorry, but...No. It's too late for that. Far too late. Hahaha. Y'know, it's funny...this situation. It reminds me of a joke.See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum...and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape. So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight...stretching away to freedom.Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend daredn't make the leap. Y'see...y'see, he's afraid of falling. So the first guy gets an idea. He says, ""Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!""B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says...he says ""What do you think I am?

As I Lay Dying,Metal,Metalcore,As I Lay Dying (Excerpt),"In a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep. And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep you are not. And when you are filled with sleep, you never were. I don't know what I am. I don't know if I am or not. Jewel knows he is, because he does not know that he does not know where he is or not. He cannot empty himself for sleep because he is not what he is and he is what he is not. Beyond the unlamped wall I can hear the rain shaping the wagon that is ours, the load that is no longer theirs that felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either, lie on our wagon though it does, since only the wind and the rain shape it only to Jewel and me, that are not asleep. And Jewel is, so Addie Bundren must be. And then I must be, or I could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room. And so if I am not emptied yet, I am is.How often have I lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home."
As I Lay Dying,Metal,Metalcore,As I Lay Dying - section 40,"AddieIn the afternoon when school was out and the last one had left with his little dirty snuffling nose, instead of going home I would go down the hill to the spring where I could be quiet and hate them. It would he quiet there then, with the water bubbling up and away and the sun slanting quiet in the trees and the quiet smelling of damp and rotting leaves and new earth; especially in the early spring, for it was worst then.I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time And when I would have to look at them day after day, ""each with his and her secret and selfish thought, and blood strange to each other blood and strange to mine, and think that this seemed to be the only way I could get ready to stay dead, I would hate my father for having ever planted me. I would look forward to the times when they faulted, so I could whip them. When the switch fell I could feel it upon my flesh; when it welted and ridged it was my blood that ran, and I would think with each blow of the switch: Now you are aware of me Now I am something in your secret and selfish life, who have marked your blood with my own for ever and ever.And so I took Anse. I saw him pass the school house three or four times before I learned that he was driving four miles out of his way to do it. I noticed then how he was beginning to hump--a tall man and young --so that he looked already like a tall bird hunched in the cold weather, on the wagon seat He would pass the school house, the wagon creaking slow, his head turning slow to watch the door of the school house as the wagon passed, until he went on around the curve and out of sight. One day I went to the door and stood there when he passed. When he saw me he looked quickly away and did not look backagain.In the early spring it was worst. Sometimes I thought that I could not bear it, lying in bed at night, with the wild geese going north and their honking coming faint and high and wild out of the wild darkness, and during the day it would seem as though I couldn't wait for the last one to go so I could go down to the spring. And so when I looked up that day and saw Anse standing there in his Sunday clothes, turning his hat round and round in his hands, I said:""If you've got any womenfolks, why in the world dont they make you get your hair cut?""""I aint got none,"" he said. Then he said suddenly, driving his eyes at me like two hounds in a strange yard: ""That's what I come to see you about,""""And make you hold your shoulders up,"" I said. ""You haven't got any? But you've got a house. They tell me you've got a house and a good farm. And you live there alone, doing for yourself, do you?"" He just looked at me, turning the hat in his hands. ""A new house,"" I said. ""Are you going to get married?""And he said again, holding his eyes to mine: ""That's what I come to see you about.""Later he told me, ""I aint got no people. So that wont be no worry to you. I dont reckon you can say the same.""""No. I have people. In Jefferson.""His face fell a little. ""Well, I got a little property. I'm forehanded; I got a good honest name. I know how town folks are, but maybe when they talk to me . . .""""They might listen,"" I said. ""But they'll be hard to talk to."" He was watching my face. ""They're in the cemetery.""""But your living kin,"" he said. ""They'll be different.""""Will they?"" I said. 'I dont know. I never had any other kind.”So I took Anse. And when I knew that I had Cash, I knew that living was terrible and that this was the answer to it. That was when I learned that words are no good; that words dont ever fit even what they are trying to say at. When he was born I knew that motherhood was invented by someone who had to have a word for it because the ones that had the children didn't care whether there was a word for it or not. I knew that fear was invented by someone that had never had the fear; pride, who never had the pride. I knew that it had been, not that they had dirty noses, but that we had had to use one another by words like spiders dangling by their mouths from a beam, swinging and twisting and never touching, and that only through the blows of die switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream. I knew that it had. been, not that my aloneness had to be violated over and over each day, but that it had never been violated until Cash came. Not even by Anse in the nights.He had a word, too. Love, he called it. But I had been used to words for a long time. I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack; that when the right time Came, you wouldn't need a word for that anymore than for pride or fear. Cash did not need to say it to me nor I to him, and I would say Let Anse use it, if he wants to. So that it was Anse or love; love or Anse: it didn't matter.I would think that even while I lay with him in the dark and Cash asleep in the cradle within the swing of my hand. I would think that if he were to wake and cry, I would suckle him, too. Anse or love: it .didn't matter. My aloneness had been violated and then made whole again by the violation: time, Anse, love, what you will, outside the circle.Then I found that I had Darl. At first I would not believe it. Then I believed that I would kill Anse. It was as though he had tricked me, hidden within a word like within a paper screen and struck me in the back through it. But then I realised that I had been tricked by words older than Anse or love, and that the same word had tricked Anse too, and that my revenge would be that he would never know I was taking revenge. And when Darl was born I asked Anse to promise to take me back to Jefferson when I died, because I knew that father had been right, even when he couldn't have known he was right anymore than I could have known I was wrong.""Nonsense,"" Anse said; ""you and me aint nigh done chapping yet, with just two.""He did not know that he was dead, then. Sometimes I would lie by him in the dark, hearing the land that was now of my blood and flesh, and I would think: Anse. Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without Me like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgotten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a               and I couldn't think Anse, couldn't remember Anse. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now. And when I would think Cash and Darl that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what they call them.And so when Cora Tull would tell me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin, line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other and that sin and love and fear are-just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who could never even cook.She would tell me what I owed to my children and to Anse and to God. I gave Anse the children. I did not ask for them. I did not even ask him for what he could have given me: not-Anse. That was my duty to him, to not ask that, and that duty I fulfilled. I would be I; I would let him be the shape and echo of his word. That was more than he asked, because he could not have asked for that and been Anse, using himself so with a word.And then he died. He did not know he was dead. I would lie by him in the dark, hearing the dark land talking of Cod's love and His beauty and His sin; hearing the dark voicelessness in which the words are the deeds, and the other words that are not deeds, that are just the gaps in peoples' lacks, coming down like the cries of the geese out of the wild darkness in the old terrible nights, fumbling at the deeds like orphans to whom are pointed out in a crowd two faces and told, That is your father, your mother.I believed that I had found it. I believed that the reason was the duty to the alive, to the terrible blood, the red bitter flood boiling through the land. I would think of sin as I would think of the clothes we both wore in the world's face, of the circumspection necessary because he was he and I was I; the sin the more utter and terrible since he was the instrument ordained by God who created the sin, to sanctify that sin He had created. While I waited for him in the woods, waiting for him before he saw me, I would think of him as dressed in sin. I would think of him as thinking of me as dressed also in sin, he the more beautiful since the garment which he had exchanged for sin was sanctified. I would think of the sin as garments which we would remove in order to shape and coerce the terrible blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air. Then I would lay with Anse again--I did not lie to him: I just refused, just as I refused my breast to Cash, and Darl after their time was up--hearing the dark land talking the voiceless speech.I hid nothing. I tried to deceive no one. I would not have cared. I merely took the precautions that he thought necessary for his sake, not for my safety, but just as I wore clothes in the world's face. And I would think then when Cora talked to me, of how the high dead words in time seemed to lose even the significance of their dead sound.Then it was over. Over in the sense that he was gone and I knew that, see him again though I would, I would never again see him coming swift and secret to me in the woods dressed in sin like a gallant garment already blowing aside with the speed of his secret coming.But for me it was not over. I mean, over in the sense of beginning and ending, because to me there was no beginning nor ending to anything then. I even held Anse refraining still, not that I was holding him recessional, but as though nothing else had ever been. My children were of me alone, of the wild blood boiling along the earth, of me and of all that lived; of none and of all. Then I found that I had Jewel. When I waked to remember to discover it, he was two months gone.My father said that the reason for living is getting ready to stay dead. I knew at last what he meant and that he could not have known what he meant himself, because a man cannot know anything about cleaning up the house afterward. And so I have cleaned my house. With Jewel--I lay by the lamp, holding up my own head, watching him cap and suture it before he breathed—the wild blood boiled away and the sound of it ceased. Then there was only the milk, warm and calm, and I lying calm in the slow silence, getting ready to clean my house.I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negative Jewel. Then I gave him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of. And now he has three children that are his and not mine. And then I could get ready to die.One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, to them salvation is just words too."

Epica,Metal,Symphonic Metal,Making of ‘Cry for the Moon’,"This is the pre-production for ""Cry for the Moon"", as we recorded it at my place before entering the Excess Studio to record it as a demo trackAs you can hear, it contains drums (which I then played on my synthesizer), guitars and synthesizer, and this last one has a funny story to itSince we only had two days in the studio, we wanted to use all the time we had as efficient as possible, so we came up with the idea of recording all the synthesizer tracks as MIDI tracks on my computer before entering the studio, so we would only have to transfer that to the recording computer at the studioOkay now, here's the funny thing. Due to some exams, I wasn't able to be present during the mixing process, so when transferring these tracks to the studio recording computer, Coen and Mark, they thought it would be better if they used Mark's synthesizer for that, probably because it had more keys, but this means that all the work I had with editing, programming and finding the right sounds was just useless, because all the tracks were edited specifically to the sounds on my synthesizer and, well, not to Mark's. I do have to admit that back then, I wasn't too pleased with this, but looking back at it now, I can have a laugh out of it as well"
