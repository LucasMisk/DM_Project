Obituary,Metal,Death Metal,Mahbod Moghadam: An Obituary,"Mahbod Moghadam, the brilliant and unconventional co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, passed away in March at age 41, resulting from complications from a recurring brain tumor. A pioneering internet entrepreneur known for his outsized personality and bold vision, Moghadam left an indelible mark on how we engage with and understand online content.Born on November 17, 1982, to an Iranian Jewish family, Moghadam grew up in Encino, California. He graduated from Yale University magna cum laude in 2004 with a history and international studies degree and he received a Fulbright Scholar to France in 2005. After earning a J.D. from Stanford Law School in 2008, Moghadam began his career as an attorney.In 2009, Moghadam co-founded Rap Genius (later renamed Genius) with Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory. As the site's earliest and most prolific contributor, Moghadam helped establish Genius' irreverent voice and community-driven approach to annotating lyrics and text. Though sometimes controversial, his humorous, self-aware style was integral to Genius' early growth and popularity.Moghadam's entrepreneurial journey continued with the founding of Everipedia in 2015 with Sam Kazemian and Theodor Forselius. As Chief Community Officer, he worked to build a more inclusive, accessible online encyclopedia. His hands-on approach and tireless promotion of the site embodied his commitment to democratizing knowledge.A man of many talents, Moghadam was also an accomplished pianist with a lifelong passion for music spanning from hip-hop to classical. He was fluent in Persian, French, Arabic, and English. As an angel investor, he supported innovative startups like Coinbase and Flexport, demonstrating his keen eye for potential and his desire to foster the next generation of disruptive technologies.Throughout his career, Moghadam remained an iconoclast, unafraid to speak his mind or challenge conventions. His freewheeling attitude and penchant for provocation sometimes led to controversy, but they were also inextricable from the passion and innovative spirit that drove his success.Moghadam's legacy is one of fearless innovation and the empowerment of online communities to engage with and share knowledge on their own terms.

I don't like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and, erm... that's pretty much what I was expressing in my poem. The government... the American government - they're sneaky, they're very deceitful, they're liars, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government is one-- is one systematic government that... that nobody can trust. I don't trust them myself Interviewer: And how long have you been writing for?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Huh?Interviewer: How long have you been writing for?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Since I was four Interviewer: Do you do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do open-mics, absolutely Interviewer: What kind of reactions do you usually get?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Usually, people are... are pretty much in agreement with what I'm saying Interviewer: We overheard you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding ticket?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: That's accurate Interviewer: right. Do you wanna tell us that story?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... ""Let me tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody,"" I said. I says... ""I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour."" I says ""I'm here to pay off my speeding ticket... and I'm here to... to get my fines out of the way and get the fuck to work."" The judge says ""You can't talk like that in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court."" Then I said... I told the judge, ""If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you."" I said ""Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen."" I said ""I'm not gonna take your shit."" I said ""I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket like I said."" I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25 dollars and I says ""Here's my money, now I am leaving."" And I left it at that Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge ""I'm here to state who I am and be honest with you."" I said ""If they thought I was dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would."" And the judge says ""Yeah, you have a point,"" He goes ""You don't need to get loud,"" I said ""Don't get loud?"" I says ""I've got every right to get loud."" I says ""You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about it. You think you're god because you have a robe and you can put people up the goddamn river for 20 years? Well you're not."" And I left it at that Interviewer: Did you walk away?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes I did. I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this country's government. I just don't like it, because... they're sneaky, like I said - they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, they rip the people off. That's the American government for you. America is a third world country, and people don't recognise it... and I think that that's pretty god damn sad, that they don't recognise their own country as a third world, third rate, third class slumInterviewer: Well... Do you have any weapons?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, I do. I own a high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9mm, a 357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully automatic ground assault rifle...Interviewer: Do you think things are gonna get better before they get worse?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: No way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse. Like I said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just basically in a hopeless situation as it stands Interviewer: What do you think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even got a mind that's that...that inhumane Interviewer: are you ready for what's coming?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Ready as I'll ever be Interviewer: Most people aren't Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: There's a little saying... Dates back for generations...Interviewer: Go on...Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Be prepared for anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what? I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of it Interviewer: Would you mind reciting your poem for us?Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Not at all, I don't see why...

Immortal,Metal,Black Metal,Dance with the Devil,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was makin' a million Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of 13Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities on other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles And so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greedEveryone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting potSo Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Startin' fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well-guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to threeEveryone tryin' to be trife, never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting potThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!""The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was layin'Bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her headI'm fallin' and I can't turn back I'm fallin' and I can't turn backRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because a dance with the Devil might last you foreverOh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a

Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!Go ‘head and grip Glocks I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots I’ll watch you topple flat Put away your rings and holla back Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps Beneath the surface I’m overheatin' your receiving circuits By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches What you preach is worthless Your worship defeat the purpose Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenade So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reductionYou motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a mission To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix I’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology So you’re nothin', like diversity without equality And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet Your mind is empty and spacious Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in

Immortal,Metal,Black Metal,You Never Know,"She was on her way to becomin' a college graduate Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid The type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless At first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids The thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say Everyone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it And no one ever gave them shit except Mc Donald's and did-dick Smokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cureDon't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all planned I'm blessed just to know you I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night Can't find a reason why God came between you and IAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never knowHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad That I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute I didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower We talked about power to the people and such We spent more time together, but it was never enough I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel I was too interested in keepin' it real Perfectly honest and complete She would always call me ""cariño"" and never Technique Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks Forever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks She convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets To stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true I couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears But honey's only response was a face full of tears She could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that nightDon't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all planned I'm blessed just to know you I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night Can't find a reason why God came between you and IAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never knowI went on with my life, college and my career Ended up locked up like an animal for a year Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole In the summer, came back, intact and on track But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold Even after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home My real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone Relatively well-known around the New York underground But I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair Though gone physically, somehow it was still there I had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear So I went and visited the building where she used to live The world looks a lot different after you do a bid The way your life done changed While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta But her facial expression changed When I asked about her daughterDon't you know that time waits for no man?My fate, it's all planned I'm blessed just to know you I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night Can't find a reason why God came between you and IAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never knowShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind And she had left it there waitin' for such a long time I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first I saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door And sure enough there was an envelope With my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,"" is what the letter said""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead But when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven I thank God at least I got to know what love really was But it hurt me to see what true love really does‘Cause even though we never made love You were all that there was It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave You made me doubt the way I thought You made me want to believe And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be Baby, don't you see?I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIVHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you Promise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.""What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur But I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her She was buried on August 3rd The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond‘Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone",0.103,0.735,0.162,0.9988

Paradise Lost,Metal,Doom Metal,"Paradise Lost, Book 1","THE ARGUMENTThis first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac't: Then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. Which action past over, the Poem hasts into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, describ'd here, not in the Center (for Heaven and Earth may be suppos'd as yet not made, certainly not yet accurst) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest call'd Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of thir miserable fall. Satan awakens all his Legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief Leaders nam'd, according to the Idols known afterwards in Canaan and the Countries adjoyning. To these Satan directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created, according to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven; for that Angels were long before this visible Creation, was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the truth of this Prophesie, and what to determin thereon he refers to a full Councel. What his Associates thence attempt. Pandemonium the Palace of Satan rises, suddenly built out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in Councel.   Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the World, and all our woe,With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire That Shepherd who first taught the chosen Seed,In the Beginning how the Heavens and Earth Rose out of CHAOS: or, if Sion hill Delight thee more, and SILOA'S brook that flowed Fast by the Oracle Of God, I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support;That, to the height of this great Argument I may assert th' Eternal Providence,And justify the ways of God to men.  Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov'd our Grand Parents, in that happy state,Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off From their Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile Stirred up with Envy and Revenge, deceived The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers,He trusted to have equal'd the most High,If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battle proud With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power Hurled headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Sky With hideous ruin and combustion, down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to Arms.Nine times the space that measures day and night To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery Gulf Confounded, though immortal: But his doom Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness'd huge affliction and dismay Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:At once, as far as Angels kenn, he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde,A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam'd; yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsume'd:Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd In utter darkness, and their portion set As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n As from the Centre thrice to th' utmost Pole.Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelm'd With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,He soon discerns, and weltering by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime,Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd BEELZEBUB. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,And thence in Heaven call'd Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence, thus began.   If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd From him who, in the happy Realms of Light Cloth'd with transcendent brightness, didst outshine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,And hazard in the Glorious Enterprise Joynd with me once, now misery hath joined In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what height fall'n, so much the stronger provd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire arms? yet not for those Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict do I repent or change,Though chang'd in outward lustre, that fixt mind And high disdain, from sense of injur'd merit,That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,And study of revenge, immortal hate,And courage never to submit or yield:And what is else not to be overcome?That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deify his power Who, from the terror of this arm, so late Doubted his empire, that were low indeed,That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail;,Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal War Irreconcilable, to our grand Foe,Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.   So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.   O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers That led th' imbattled Seraphim to War Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;And put to proof his high Supremacy,Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,Too well I see and rue the dire event,That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low,As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns,Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state Here swallow'd up in endless misery.But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could have orepow'rd such force as ours)Have left us this our spirit and strength entire Strongly to suffer and support our pains,That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of War, what e're his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;What can it the avail though yet we feel Strength undiminished, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment?""Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.   Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,To do ought good never will be our task,But ever to do ill our sole delight,As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist. If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,Our labour must be to pervert that end,And out of good still to find means of evil;Which ofttimes may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destined aim.But see! the angry Victor hath recall'd His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,The seat of desolation, voyd of light,Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves,There rest, if any rest can harbour there,And, reassembling our afflicted Powers,Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,How overcome this dire Calamity,What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,If not, what resolution from despare.   Thus Satan, talking to his nearest Mate With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,TITANIAN or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th' Ocean-stream:Him, haply slumbering on the NORWAY foam The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,With fixed Anchor in his scaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs,That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag'd might see How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc't, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.Then with expanded wings he steers his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, if it were land that ever burn'd With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;And such appear'd in hue as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side Of thundering AETNA, whose combustible And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving Fire,Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the Winds,And leave a singed bottom all involv'd With stench and smoke: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.   Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,Said then the Lost Archangel, this the seat That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: farthest from him is best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supreme Above his equals. Farewell, happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail, horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.The mind is its own place, and in itself Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.What matter where, if I be still the same,And what I should be, all but less than hee Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:Here we may reign secure, and in my choice To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n.But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,Th' associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?   So SATAN spake; and him BEELZEBUBThus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,Which, but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults Their surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious hight.   He scarce had ceas't when the superior Fiend Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,Behind him cast; The broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views At Ev'ning, from the top of FESOLE,Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,He walkt with to support uneasy steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heaven's Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay entranc't Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades High overarch't imbow'r; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld From the safe shore their floating Carcases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown,Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,Under amazement of their hideous change.He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,If such astonishment as this can seize Eternal spirits; Or have ye chos'n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conqueror? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rolling in the Flood With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern Th' advantage, and, descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.   They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.Nor did they not perceive the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable. As when the potent Rod Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evil day Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even balance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;A multitude, like which the populous North Pour'd never from her frozen loyns to pass RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither haste where stood Their great Commander—godlike Shapes, and Forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities,And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on Thrones;Though on their Names in Heav'nly Records now Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVEGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God their Creator, and th' invisible Glory of him, that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,And Devils to adore for Deities:Then were they known to men by various Names,And various Idols through the Heathen World.Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,At their great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?The chief were those who, from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd Among the Nations round, and durst abide JEHOVAH thundering out of SION, thron'd Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd Within his Sanctuary itself their Shrines,Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites and solemn Feasts profan'd,And with their darkness durst affront his light.First MOLOCH, horrid King, besmear'd with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Their childrens cries unheard, that passed through fire To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITEWorshipt in RABBA and her watery Plain,In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,From AROER to NEBO and the wild Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBONAnd HERONAIM, SEONS Real, beyond The flowery Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd ISRAEL in SITTIM, on their march from NILETo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.With these came they, who from the bordering flood Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,These feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is their Sssence pure,Not ti'd or manacl'd with jo Ynt or limb,Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,Can execute their aerie purposes,And works of love or enmity fulfil.For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook Their living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes. With these in troop Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,In SION also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,Beguiled by fair Idolatresses, fell To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate In amorous ditties all a Summers day,While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off,In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,Where he fell flat and sham'd his Worshippers:DAGON his name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertile Banks Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.He also against the house of God was bold:A leper once he lost, and gain'd a King,AHAZ his sottish conqueror, whom he drew Gods altar to disparage and displace For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn His odious offerings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquished. After these appear'd A crew who under Names of old Renown,OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek Thir wandering Gods disguis'd in brutish forms Rather than human. Nor did ISRAEL scape Th' infection, when their borrow'd Gold compos'd The calf in OREB; and the Rebel King Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,JEHOVAH, who, in one Night when he pass'd From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.BELIAL came last, than whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for itself: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smok'd; yet who more oft than hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd With lust and violence the house of God.In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above their loftiest Towrs,And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night In GIBEAH, when the hospitable Dores Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.These were the prime in order and in might;The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held Gods, yet confessed later than Heav'n and Earth Their boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'n first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVEHis own and RHEA'S Son, like measure found;So JOVE usurping reign'd: these, first in CREETAnd IDA known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.All these and more came flocking; but with looks Downcast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd Obscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd Their fainting courage, and dispel'd their fears.Then straight commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreared His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc'd Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forest huge of Spears; and thronging Helms Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd To height of noblest temper Hero's old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views,thir order due,Thir visages and stature as of Gods,Thir number last he summs. And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man,Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these Could merit more than that small infantry Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,DAMASCO, or Marocco AROCCO, or TREBISOND,Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd Their dread Commander: he, above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her original brightness, nor appeared Less than Arch Angel ruined, and th' excess Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shone Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrenched, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion, to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned For ever now to have their lot in pain,Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't Of Heav'n, and from eternal splendours flung For his revolt, yet faithful how they stood,Their Glory withered. As, when Heavens Fire Hath scath'd the Forest Oaks or Mountain Pines,With singed top their stately growth, though bare Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute.Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way.   O Myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers Matchless, but with th' Almighty!—and that strife Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Forseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse?For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,If counsels different, or danger shun'd By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav'n till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,Consent or custom, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New war R provok't:; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe.Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither, or elsewhere:For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Celestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr Open or understood, must be resolv'd.   He spake: and, to confirm his words, out-flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.   There stood a Hill not far, whose grisly top Belch'd fire and rolling smoak; the rest entire Shone with a glossy scurf, undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,The work of Sulphur. Thither, wing'd with speed A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands Of Pioners, with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heave'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,Than aught divine or holy else enjoy'd In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught,Ransack'd the Centre, and with impious hands Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op'ned into the Hill a spacious wound And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best Deserve the precious bane. And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,Learn how their greatest Monuments of Fame,And Strength and Art are easily outdone By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toil And hands innumerable scarce perform Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude With wondrous Art founded the massy Ore,Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:A third as soon had form'd within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.Anon out of the earth a Fabric huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Aymphonies and voices sweet,Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,Nor great Al CAIRO such magnificence Equal'd in all their glories, to enshrine BELUS or SERAPIS their Gods, or seat Their Kings, when EGYPT with ASSYRIA strove In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile Stood fixed her stately highth, and strait the dores Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendent by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets, fed With Naptha and ASPHALTUS, yeilded light As from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,Where Sceptr'd Angels held their residence,And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.Nor was his name unheard or unador'd In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve A summer's day, and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught availed him now To have built in Heav'n high towers; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell.Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd From every Band and squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; They anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or career with Lance)Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,Pour forth their populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,The suburb of their Straw-built Cittadel,New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer Their State affairs: so thick the aerie crowd Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,Behold a wonder! they but now who seemed In bigness to surpass Earth's Giant Sons Now less than smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon Sits Arbitress, and nearer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they, on their mirth & dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc'd their shapes immense, and were at large,Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court. But far within And in their own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat,A thousand Demi-Gods on golden seat's,Frequent and full. After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began.",0.122,0.74,0.138,0.9986

There was a place Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change Where TIGRIS, at the foot of Paradise Into a gulf shot under ground, till part Rose up a fountain by the Tree of Life:In with the river sunk, and with it rose Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land From Eden over Pontus and the pool Maeotis,up beyond the river Ob;Downward as far antarctick;and in length West from Orontes to the ocean barr'd At Darien; thence to the land where flows Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roam'd With narrow search; and with inspection deep Considered every creature, which of all Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field Him after long debate, irresolute Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose Fit Vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom To enter, and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark As from his wit and native subtlety Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed Doubt might beget of diabolick power Active within, beyond the sense of brute Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward grief His bursting passion into plaints thus poured More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built With second thoughts, reforming what was old!   O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred For what God, after better, worse would build?Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens That shine, yet bear their bright officious Lamps,Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,In thee concentring all their precious beams Of sacred influence! As God in Heav'n Is Center, yet extends to all; so thou Centring, receav'st from all those Orbs: in thee,Not in themselves, all thir known virtue appears Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth Of creatures animate with gradual life Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.With what delight could I have walked thee round If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these Find place or refuge; and the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries: all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n To dwell, unless by mastering Heav'ns Supreame;Nor hope to be myself less miserable By what I seek, but others to make such As I, though thereby worse to me redound:For only in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyd Or won to what may work his utter loss,For whom all this was made, all this will soon Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe,In woe then; that destruction wide may range:To me shall be the glory sole among The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days Continued making; and who knows how long Before had been contriving? though perhaps Not longer than since I in one Night, freed From servitude inglorious well nigh half The angelick name, and thinner left the throng Of his adorers: He, to be avenged And to repair his numbers thus impaired Whether such virtue spent of old now failed More Angels to create, if they at least Are his created, or, to spite us more Determined to advance into our room A creature formed of earth, and him endow Exalted from so base original With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed He effected; Man he made, and for him built Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,Him Lord pronounc'd; and, O indignity!Subjected to his service angel-wings And flaming ministers to watch and tend Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance I dread; and, to elude; thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and prie In every Bush and Brake, where hap may find The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.O foul descent! that I, who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime This essence to incarnate and imbrute That to the highth of Deity aspired!But what will not Ambition and Revenge Descend to?

Thou therefore now advise Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present,Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind The woodbine round this arbour, or direct The clasping ivy where to climb; while IIn yonder spring of roses intermixed With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:For, while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose, what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on; which intermits Our day's work, brought to little, though begun Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?   To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd,Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond Compare above all living creatures dear!Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd How we might best fulfil the work which here God hath assign'd us; nor of me shalt pass Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found In woman, than to study houshold good And good works in her husband to promote Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed Labour, as to debar us when we need Refreshment, whether food, or talk between Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow To brute denied, and are of love the food;Love, not the lowest end of human life For not to irksome toil, but to delight He made us, and delight to reason joined These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide As we need walk, till younger hands ere long Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:For solitude sometimes is best society And short retirement urges sweet return But other doubt possesses me, lest harm Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest What hath been warned us, what malicious foe Envying our happiness, and of his own Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage, us asunder;Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each To other speedy aid might lend at need:Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealty from God, or to disturb Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks Safest and seemliest by her husband stays Who guards her, or with her the worst endures   To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE,As one who loves, and some unkindness meets With sweet austere composure thus reply'd.   Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,That such an enemy we have, who seeks Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn And from the parting Angel over-heard As in a shady nook I stood behind Just then returned at shut of Evening Flours.But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear His violence thou fearest not, being such As we, not capable of death or pain Can either not receive, or can repel His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?   To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd.Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE,For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid The attempt itself, intended by our foe For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul; suppos'd Not incorruptible of Faith, not proff Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;Or daring, first on me th' assault shall light.Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid I, from the influence of thy looks, receive Access in every Vertue; in thy sight More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on Shame to be overcome or over-reacht Would utmost vigour raise, and rais'd unite.Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present, and thy trial choose With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.   So spake domestick ADAM in his care And Matrimonial Love; but EVE, who thought Less attributed to her Faith sincere,Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.   If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit straitened by a foe Subtle or violent, we not endued Single with like defence, wherever met;How are we happy, still in fear of harm?But harm precedes not sin: only our foe Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity: his foul esteem Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feard By us? who rather double honour gain From his surmise proved false; find peace within Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed Alone, without exteriour help sustained?Let us not then suspect our happie State Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,As not secure to single or combin'd Frail is our happiness, if this be so And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed   To whom thus ADAM fervently reply'd.O Woman, best are all things as the will Of God ordaind them: His creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created, much less Man Or aught that might his happy state secure Secure from outward force; within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his power:Against his will he can receive no harm But God left free the will; for what obeyes Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,But bid her well be ware, and still erect,Lest, by some fair-appearing good surpris'd She dictate false; and missinform the Will To do what God expressly hath forbid.Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoynes,That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the Foe suborn'd,And fall into deception unaware,Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.Seek not temptation then, which to avoid Were better, and most likely if from me Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve First thy obedience; th' other who can know,Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?But if thou think, trial unsought may find Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;Go in thy native innocence, relie On what thou hast of virtue, summon all,For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine   So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde; but EVEPersisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.   With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,May find us both perhaps far less prepar'd,The willinger I goe, nor much expect A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand Soft she withdrew, and, like a Wood-Nymph light Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport Though not as she with bow and quiver armed But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought,To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd,Likest she seemed, POMONA when she fled VERTUMNUS, or to Ceres in her Prime Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from Jove Her long with ardent look his eye pursued Delighted, but desiring more her stay.Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,Repeated; shee to him as oft engag'd To be returned by Noon amid the Bowre,And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast, or Afternoon's repose.O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve Of thy presumed return! event perverse!Thou never from that hour in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way, or send thee back Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde The only two of Mankinde, but in them The whole included Race, his purposed prey.In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,Their tendance, or Plantation for delight,By fountain or by shady rivulet He sought them both, but wished his hap might find Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round About her glowed, oft stooping to support Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while Herself, though fairest unsupported flower From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd Of stateliest Covert, cedar, pine, or palm;Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov'n Arborets, and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE:Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis, or renowned Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse Much he the Place admir'd, the Person more.As one who long in populous city pent Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe Among the pleasant villages and farms Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;She most, and in her look sums all Delight.Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVEThus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form Angelick, but more soft, and feminine Her graceful innocence, her every air Of gesture, or least action, overawed His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:That space the Evil-one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remained Stupidly good; of enmitie disarm'd,Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:But the hot Hell that always in him burns Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet Compulsion thus transported, to forget What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy Save what is in destroying; other joy To me is lost. Then, let me not let pass Occasion which now smiles; behold alone The woman, opportune to all attempts Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh Whose higher intellectual more I shun And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;Foe not informidable! exempt from wound I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!Not terrible, though terrour be in Love And beautie, not approached by stronger hate,Hate stronger, under show of love well feign'd,The way which to her ruin now I tend.   So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve Addressed his way: not with indented wave Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear Circular base of rising folds, that towered Fold above fold, a surging maze! his Head Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape,And lovely; never since of Serpent kind Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd Hermione and Cadmus,or the god In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;He with Olympias;  this with her who bore Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique At first, as one who sought access, but feard To interrupt, side-long he works his way.As when a Ship, by skilful Steersmen wrought Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;So varied he, and of his tortuous Traine Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,To lure her Eye; she, busied, heard the sound Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used To such disport before her through the field From every beast; more duteous at her call Then at Circean call the herd disguis'd Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowed His turret crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,Fawning, and licked the ground whereon she trod His gentle dumb expression turnd at length The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he, glad Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue Organick, or impulse of vocal Air,His fraudulent temptation thus began.   Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps Thou canst, who art sole Wonder! much less arm Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,Thee all  living things gaze on, all things thine By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore With ravishment beheld, there best beheld Where universally admir'd; but here In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne Half what in thee is fair, one man except,Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who should be seen A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.   So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tun'd:Into the Heart of EVE his words made way,Though at the voice much marvelling; at length Not unamaz'd, she thus in answer spake.What may this mean? language of man pronounced By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?The first, at least, of these I thought denied To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day Created mute to all articulate sound:The latter I demur; for in their looks Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;Redouble then this miracle, and say,How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?Say, for such wonder claims attention due   To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!Easie to mee it is to tell thee all What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyd:I was at first as other Beasts that graze The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low As was my food; nor aught but food discern'd Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced A goodly tree far distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;When from the boughs a savoury odour blow'n,Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play To satisfy the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,Powerful persuaders, quick'nd at the scent Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;For, high from ground, the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the Tree All other Beasts that saw, with like desire Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour At Feed or Fountain never had I found Sated at length, ere long I might perceave Strange alteration in me, to degree Of reason in my inward powers; and speech Wanted not long; though to this shape retaind.Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind Considered all things visible in Heav'n Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;But all that fair and good in thy Divine Semblance, and in thy Beauties heavenly Ray United I beheld; no Fair to thine Equivalent or second, which compel'd Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.   So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied   Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?For many are the trees of God that grow In Paradise, and various, yet unknown To us; in such abundance lies our choice As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched Still hanging incorruptible, till men Grow up to their provision, and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her birth   To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.Empress, the way is ready, and not long;Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past Of blowing Myrrh and Balme: if thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon   Lead then, said EVE. Hee leading, swiftly rolled In tangles, and made intricate seem straight To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy Bright'ns his Crest; as when a wandering fire Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night Condenses, and the cold environs round Kindled through agitation to a flame Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends Hovering and blazing with delusive light Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud Led EVE, our credulous m Mother, to the tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe;Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.   Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;God so commanded, and left that command Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to ourselves; our reason is our law   To whom the Tempter guilefully replied Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?   To whom thus EVE, yet sinless. Of the Fruit Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.   She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold The Tempter, but with show of Zeale and Love To Man, and indignation at his wrong,New part puts on; and, as to passion mov'd Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely, and in act Rais'd, as of some great matter to begin.As when of old some Orator renound In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addrest,Stood in himself collected, while each part,Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue,Sometimes in highth began, as no delay Of preface brooking, through his Zeal of Right.So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown The Tempter all impassiond thus began.   O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power Within me cleere, not only to discern Things in their causes, but to trace the ways Of highest agents, deemd however wise.Queen of this Universe, doe not believe Those rigid threats of Death: ye shall not die:How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life To knowledge; By the Threatener? look on mee,Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,And life more perfect have attaind than Fate Meant mee, by ventring higher than my Lot.Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast Is open? or will God incense his ire For such a petty Trespass, and not praise Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,Deterred not from achieving what might leade To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:Your fear itself of death removes the fear Why then was this forbid? Why, but to awe,Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,His worshippers; He knows that in the day Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods Knowing both good and evil, as they know That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man Internal Man, is but proportion meet;I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,Though threat'nd, which no worse than this can bring And what are Gods that Man may not become As they, participating God-like food?The Gods are first, and that advantage use On our belief, that all from them proceeds,I question it, for this fair Earth I see,Warmed by the Sun, producing every kind,Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclos'd Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree Impart against his will if all be his?Or is it envy? and can envy dwell In heav'nly breasts? these, these, and many more Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste   He ended; and his words, replete with guile Into her heart too easy entrance won:Fixed on the Fruit she gazed, which to behold Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked An eager appetite, raised by the smell So savoury of that fruit, which with desire Inclinable now grown to touch or taste Solicited her longing eye; yet first Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay Gave elocution to the mute, and taught The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding Commends thee more, while it infers the good By thee communicated, and our want:For good unknown sure is not had; or, had And yet unknown, is as not had at all In plain then, what forbids he but to know Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?Such prohibitions bind not. But, if Death Bind us with after-bands, what profits then Our inward freedom? In the day we eate Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns Irrational till then. For us alone Was death invent'd? or to us deni'd This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy The good befall'n him, author unsuspect Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile What fear I then? rather, what know to feare Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,Of God or Death, of law or Penaltie?Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,Of virtue to make wise: what hinders then To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?    So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit,she pluck'd, she eat Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk The guiltie Serpent, and well might;for Eve Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed In fruit she never tasted, whether true Or fancied so, through expectation high Of knowledge; nor was Godhead from her thought Greedily she ingorged without restraint And knew not eating death: Satiate at length And hight'nd as with wine, jocund and boon,Thus to herself she pleasingly began,   O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees In Paradise! of operation blest To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end Created; but henceforth my early care Not without song, each morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease Of thy full branches offered free to all;Till, dieted by thee I grow mature In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;Though others envy what they cannot give;For had the gift been theirs, it had not here Thus grown. Experience, next, to thee I owe,Best guide; not following thee, I had remained In ignorance, thou op'net Wisdom's way,And giv'st access, though secret she retire.And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high High, and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps May have diverted from continual watch Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies About him. But to Adam in what sort Shall I appear? shall I to him make known As yet my change, and give him to partake Full happiness with me, or rather not But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power Without copartner? so to add what wants In female sex, the more to draw his love And render me more equal; and perhaps A thing not undesirable, somtime Superiour; for inferiour who is free?This may be well: But what if God have seen And death ensue? then I shall be no more!And Adam, wedded to another Eve Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;A death to think! Confirmed then I resolve Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:So dear I love him, that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life   So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,But first low reverence done, as to the Power That dwelt within, whose presence had infused Into the plant sciential sap, derived From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while Waiting desirous her return, had wove Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;As reapers oft are won't their harvest-queen Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new Solace in her return, so long delay'd:Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;And forth to meet her went, the way she took That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,Scarce from the Tree returning; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit that downy smil'd,New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd,To him she hasted; in her face excuse Came prologue, and apology too prompt;Which, with bland words at will, she thus addrest.   Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived Thy presence; agony of love till now Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:This tree is not, as we are told, a tree Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown Opening the way, but of divine effect To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;And hath been tasted such; The serpent wise Or not restrained as we, or not obeying Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,Not dead, as we are threaten'd, but thenceforth Endu'd with human voice and human sense,Reasoning to admiration, and with mee Perswasively hath so prevaild, that IHave also tasted, and have also found Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler heart,And growing up to Godhead; which for thee Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;Least, thou not tasting, different degree Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit   Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed On the other side Adam, soon as he heard The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve Down dropt, and all the faded Roses shed:Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke.   O fairest of Creation, last and best Of all God's works, Creature in whom excell'd Whatever can to sight or thought be found,Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress The strict forbiddance, how to violate The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,And mee with thee hath ruined; for with thee Certain my resolution is to die:How can I live without thee! how forego Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined To live again in these wild woods forlorn!Should God create another Eve, and IAnother rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart: no, no, I feel The Link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe   So having said, as one from sad dismay Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed Submitting to what seemed remediless,Thus in calm mood his Words to EVE he turnd.   Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd Had it been only coveting to Eye That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,Much more to taste it under banne to touch.But past who can recall, or done undoe?Not God omnipotent, for Fate; yet so Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the fact Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit Profaned first by the serpent, by him first Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man Higher degree of life; inducement strong To us, as likely tasting to attain Proportional ascent; which cannot be But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-Gods.Nor can I think that God, Creator wise Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy Us his prime creatures, dignifi'd so high,Set over all his Works; which in our Fall For us created, needs with us must faile,Dependent made; so God shall uncreate Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;Not well conceived of God, who, though his power Creation could repeat, yet would be loth Us to abolish, lest the Adversary Triumph, and say; ""Fickle their state whom God""Most favours; who can please him long? Me first""He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?""Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.However I with thee have fixed my lot Certain to undergo like doom: if Death Consort with thee, Death is to mee as life;So forcible within my heart I feel The bond of Nature draw me to my owne,My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;Our State cannot be severd, we are one,One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.   So ADAM; and thus EVE to him repli'd.O glorious trial of exceeding Love,Illustrious evidence, example high!Ingaging me to emulate, but short Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,ADAM, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,Rather than Death or aught than Death more dread Shall separate us, linked in love so dear To undergo with me one guilt, one crime If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,Direct, or by occasion hath presented This happie trial of thy Love, which else So eminently never had bin known.Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue This my attempt, I would sustain alone The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd Remarkably so late of thy so true,So faithful Love unequald; but I feel Far otherwise th;  event; not Death, but Life Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.On my experience, Adam, freely taste And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.   So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy Tenderly wept, much won that he his love Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur Divine displeasure for her sake, or death In recompence for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing fruit With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat Against his better knowledge; not deceived But fondly overcome with female charm Earth trembled from her entrails, as again In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin Original; while Adam took no thought Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass feared, the more to soothe Him with her lov'd societie, that now As with new wine intoxicated both They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel Divinity within them breeding wings Wherewith to scorn the earth: but that false fruit Farr other operation first displaid,Carnal desire enflaming, he on Eve Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move,   Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste And elegant, of sapience no small part;Since to each meaning savour we apply And palate call judicious; I the praise Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained From this delightful fruit, nor known till now True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden, it might be wished For this one tree had been forbidden ten But come, so well refreshed, now let us play As meet is, after such delicious fare;For never did thy Beautie, since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd With all perfections, so enflame my sense With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now Than ever, bountie of this virtuous tree!   So said he, and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank Thick overhead with verdant roof imbow'rd He led her nothing loth; Flours were the Couch,Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.There they their fill of love and love's disport Took largely, of their mutual guilt the Seale,The solace of their sin, till dewy sleep Oppress'd them, wearied with their amorous play.Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit That with exhilarating vapour bland About their spirits had plaid, and inmost powers Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams Encumbered, now had left them, up they rose As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds How darkened; innocence, that as a veil Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;Just confidence, and native righteousness,And honour from about them, naked left To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked Shorn of his strength. They destitute and bare Of all their virtue: silent, and in face Confounded, long they sate, as struck'n mute:Till ADAM, though not less than EVE abash't,At length gave utterance to these words constraind.   O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care To that false worm, of whomsoever taught To counterfeit Mans voice; true in our Fall,False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void Of innocence, of faith, of purity Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained And in our faces evident the signs Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;Even shame, the last of evils; of the first Be sure then. How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes Will dazle now this earthly, with their blaze Insufferably bright. O might I here In solitude live savage, in some glad Obscur'd, where highest Woods, impenetrable To Starr or Sun-light, spread their umbrage broad,And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs Hide me, where I may never see them more.But let us now, as in bad plight, devise What best may for the present serve to hide The parts of each from other, that seem most To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed And girded on our loins, may cover round Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame There sit not, and reproach us as unclean   So couns'led hee, and both together went Into the thickest Wood; there soon they chose The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned But such as at this day, to Indians known In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms Branching so broad and long, that in the ground The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow About the mother tree, a pillared shade High over-arched, and echoing walks between:There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds At loop-holes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves They gathered, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe,And with what skill they had, together sewed To gird their waist; vain Covering if to hide Their guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike To that first naked Glory! Such of late Columbus found the American, so girt With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild Among the trees on isles and woody shores Thus fenced, and, as they thought, thir shame in part Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,They sat them down to weep, nor onely Teares Raind at their Eyes, but high winds worse within Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore Their inward state of mind, calm region once And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:For Understanding ruled not, and the Will Heard not her lore; both in subjection now To sensual Appetite, who from beneath Usurping over sovran Reason claimed Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,ADAM, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,Speech intermitted thus to EVE renewed.   Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd With me, as I besought thee, when that strange Desire of wandring, this unhappie Morn,I know not whence possessed thee; we had then Remained still happie, not as now, despoiled Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.   To whom, soon mov'd with touch of blame thus EVE.What words have passed thy Lips, ADAM severe,Imput'st thou that to my default, or will Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,Or to thyself perhaps: hadst thou been there,Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;No ground of enmitie between us known,Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harme.Was I to have never parted from thy side?As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head Command me absolutely not to go,Going into such danger as thou saidst?Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.Hadst thou been firm and fixt in thy dissent,Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.   To whom then first incenst ADAM repli'd.Is this the Love, is this the recompence Of mine to thee, ingrateful EVE, exprest Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,Who might have liv'd and joyed immortal bliss,Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:And am I now upbraided, as the cause Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold The danger, and the lurking Enemie That lay in wait; beyond this had been force,And force upon free Will hath here no place.But confidence then bore thee on, secure Either to meet no danger, or to find Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps I also err'd, in overmuch admiring What seemed in thee so perfet, that I thought No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue The errour now, which is become my crime,And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall Him who to worth in Women overtrusting Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,She first his weak indulgence will accuse.   Thus they in mutual accusation spent The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;And of thir vain contest appear'd no end.",0.127,0.686,0.186,1.0

The Ramones,Rock,Punk Rock,The Ramones’ “Ramones” (33 1/3 excerpt),"In  her  classic 1969 essay ""Trash, Art, and the Movies,"" Pauline Kael wrote of ""trash"" films that  when  ""you  clean  them  up, when you make movies respectable,  you kill them. The well­ spring of their art, their greatness, is in not being re­spectable.""91 While  it  could  be said  that  punk  fought long and hard against respectability,  there is no denying that the early to mid-1970s New York scene from which it emerged  was a heady mix of artists and performers. It's  almost impossible  today to imagine  a contemporary music scene  as peopled  with artists, writers, and filmmakers as the early punk move­ment  was, with  people  like Andy Warhol, William  S. Burroughs, Patti  Smith,  Mary  Harron, Arturo  Vega, Amos Poe, Ellen Willis, Gerard  Malanga,  and others  all part of the scene. As Dick Hebdige has noted, ""the New York punk bands had pieced  together from  a variety  of acknowl­edged  'artistic' sources-from  the literary  avant-garde and  the  underground cinema-a self-consciously  pro­fane and terminal  aesthetic.""92This  isn't  to suggest a calculated  effort, at least not by the Ramones,  to draw on artistic sources,  but rather that part of what made the band great was its emergence from  a vibrant  New York movement  in which distinc­tions between pop culture and art were blurred. A friend of mine always likes to point  out that British punk was more ""authentic"" than American  because it came from the working class, as opposed to the suburbs. But leaving aside the problems of this distinction (claims of authen­ticity are always tricky and a little condescending) what I think he misses in that view is that it was the very impurity  of punk-its mixing  of suburban   and  down­ town, of high art and ""stoopid,"" of camp and sincerity, of humor and violence-that made it so radical. Arguments about  purity  or authenticity of punk inevitably  end up excluding the messy, impure,  hybrid qualities that keep it sounding fresh thirty  years later.In fact, prior to his involvement in the band, Tommy Ramone  had even made avant-garde films: ""I was  into  film-making. I guess I was jumping  around. I went  to work  for  this film company.  I was hanging around  the Museum  of Modern Art 'cause the company was right next to the Museum. I would take three-hour lunch  breaks and watch all the movies there  and I got into  avant-garde films. I started  making some stuff like that.""93 The Pop Art movement of the 195Os and 60s-of which Andy Warhol was the American  Giant-had  al­ready smashed  distinctions between  ""high"" and ""low"" culture;  by the 1970s it wasn't that what punk was doing by mixing styles was new, rather  that they had re-infused the process with a sense of fun and danger.According  to Craig Leon, most of the work with the band was completed  in seven days: ""It  took  just three days to get  the  music down,  four  for  the vocals.""94   In the  era  of  bloated,  super  group  excess, $6,400  was a paltry  amount  of money.  ""Some  albums  were  costing a half-million  dollars to make,"" Joey noted, ""and taking two or three years to record, like Fleetwood Mac ... ""95 At first, the process sounds like the ultimate do-it-your­self, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk. In  truth,   however,  the  Ramones   approached  the  re­ cording  process with a high degree of preparedness and professionalism  and a fiercely self-contained, unified sound.  But this had  not  always been  the  case. In July 1974 Tommy became the Ramones' drummer, and the band's sound  underwent a change: ""To them it was just a hobby,""  he told Punk in 1976, ""to me it was an avant­ garde thing. Then we started  getting  really good  and I said, 'This isn't  avant-garde, this is commercial!' And that's  when  I started  playing  drums.  When I saw the $signs$ ...  changed  the whole sound of the group into  the way it is now-you know-hard rock.""96Near  the  end  of  1974,  the  band  recorded   fifteen demos  in  one  day. These were  ""just  basic tracks  and vocals and  mixes of most  of the  songs  that  made  up their first album.""97 In September 1975 they cut the two Marty  Thau demos  (""Judy  Is a Punk""  and  ""I  Wanna Be Your  Boyfriend"").  The sound  on  the Thau demos is somewhat richer and warmer than on the other demos, and it hints at a more pop-oriented, melodic sensibility that shows how, with a slightly different  approach,  the Ramones' sound  could  be less assaultive.Although  the  band wanted  to suggest  the intensity of their live performances, the album was in no way intended to be ""live."" As Craig  Leon  notes, ""capturing the energy  of the live shows  was quite  important. But if you jump to the conclusion  that the sound  of the recording was just the sound of the band live you would be mistaken even though  that was what I was trying  to convey. The  album is quite layered and structured and took full advantage of the studio technology of its time without being obvious.""98 This tension-how to transfer the spirit of live performance without simply replicating it-was something that haunted  punk, and in some ways worked against it. For if progressive,  virtuoso  rock encouraged  deep,  repeat  listenings  and  a cultivated  appreciation for  complexity,  punk  assaulted  the  listener in a way that  almost  begged  for  a live audience.  One of the reasons punk did not move gently into the main­stream or receive more radio play was precisely because it was always about more than the music on the album: it was a stance, an attitude, that was difficult to transfer to vinyl.Yet the band, and Craig  Leon,  were determined to create  a live feel to  the  album.  ""I  actually  toyed  with the idea,"" says Leon,  ""of the recording being one long band  with  no breaks"" in a way that  would  capture  the no-break-between-songs live performances. There  are hints of this at the end of the album's second side, where ""I  Don't Wanna  Walk  Around  with You"" is followed by ""Today Your  Love,  Tomorrow the  World""  with no  break.  There were  other   experiments that  didn't happen, either, according to Leon: ""here was a quad­raphonic version that I played around  with doing. I did a  lot of quad  encoded  work in  those  days and  almost did the  Ramones  album  that  way.""99   By the  time  they went into the studio  to record,  the Ramones had devel­oped  an  archive  of songs  and  had  honed  their  sound before audiences at numerous shows. ""We had the songs for  the  first  three  albums  when  we did  the first one,"" Johnny has said. ""We  already had 30 to 35 songs, and we recorded  them  in  the  chronological order  that  we wrote  them.  I didn't want  the  second  album  to  be a letdown  by picking through the best songs for the first one and using the lesser songs for the second album.""100?Before considering details of the album's production, it's worth noting how difficult it was-then, as now-for a good band to make the transition from live act to meaningful  recorded  presence. Indeed,  the pages of the underground music press in New York City in the mid-1970s are full of ads and enthusiastic write-ups for enormously popular  punk bands at the club level that subsequently  failed to  transfer  that  spirit  to vinyl. In ""The State of Pop Music in New York: A Symposium"" from the Village Voice, musician  and  record  producer  Tony Silvester noted  that the ""reason  a lot of great acts don't happen on records is because they don't feel that tension that  they feel live-9 out  of 10 times on a record  they try to duplicate  the club scene and it doesn't happen."" What's missing,  Silvester  claimed,  is ""simplicity  from the standpoint of production.""101Here  is  Craig  Leon  addressing  the  album's production:The album was recorded purely. Nothing covered up. The same way that you would record a classical or jazz work. We use the same mic placement techniques on the London Symphony Orchestra or the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra today that we used on the Ra­mones in 1976. These  techniques are the same as what you would have gotten  on classical or  jazz re­cordings or  for that matter  good  pop  recordings  in 1956. The  sound of the music in the room. Minimal effects other  than those created naturally. But it was not ""cinéma vérité"" all live and raw.We did a lot of overdubbing and double-tracked vocals, going for a bizarre emulation of the recording values of ""A Hard Day's Night."" The stereo image was inspired by that as well. Due to the limitations of 4 track recording in the 60s the image on the old Beatles records in stereo used to have the entire backing track on the left and vocals and tambourine overdubs or whatever on the right. This fit the thee-piece sound of the Ramones perfectly. There was a conventional mix of the recording but it wasn't as effective. Also, a mono mix. Some of those tracks surfaced on singles. The mono version is quite powerful....Notes...91.  Pauline Kael, ""Trash, Art, and the Movies,"" p. 115.92.  Dick Hebdige, Subculture, p. 27.93.

Why else would you dress up as a flying rat?You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else! Only you won't admit it!You have to keep pretending that life makes sense. That there's some point to all this struggling. GOD you make me want to puke!I mean what is it with you? What made you what you are?Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe? Brother carved up by some mugger? Something like that I bet...something like that......something like that...happened to me, you know? I'm...I'm not exactly sure what it was. Sometimes, I remember it one way, sometimes another...if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice! Haha!My point is...my point is, I went crazy. When I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot!I admit it! So why can't you? You're not unintelligent, you must see the reality of the situation?Do you know how many times we've come close to World War III over a flock of geese on a computer screen? Do you even know what triggered the last world war? An argument with Germany over how many telegraph poles they owed their war debt creditors. Telegraph poles!It's all a joke! Anything anybody ever valued or struggled for, it's all just a monstrous, demented gag.So why can't you see the funny side?Why aren't you laughing?(Batman crashes through a mirror and attacks the Joker)Batman:Because I've heard it before...and it wasn't funny the first time.(Batman throws the Joker through another mirror.)Incidentally, I spoke to Commissioner Gordon before I came in here. He's fine. Despite all your sick, vicious little games, he's as sane as he ever was. So maybe ordinary people don't always crack. Maybe there isn't any need to crawl under a rock with all the other slimy things when trouble hits. Maybe it was just you, all the time.Joker:NO! (Joker pulls Batman's cowl down, blocking his vision and attacking him.)Batman:Don't...(Joker pulls out a gun, but when he pulls the trigger a white flag shoots out with the words CLICK CLICK CLICK)Joker:God damn it...it's empty! Well? What are you waiting for? I shot a defenseless girl, I terrorized an old man. Why don't you kick the hell out of me and get a standing ovation from the public gallery?Batman:Because I'm doing this one by the book...and because I don't want to. Do you understand? I don't want to hurt you. I don't want either of us to end up killing the other...but we're both running out of alternatives...and we both know it. Maybe it all hinges on tonight. Maybe this is our last chance to sort this bloody mess out. If you don't take it, then we're locked onto a suicide course. Both of us. To the death. It doesn't have to end like that. I don't know what it was that bent your life out of shape, but who knows? Maybe I've been there too. Maybe I can help. We could work together. I could rehabilitate you. You needn't be out there on the edge any more. You needn't be alone. We don't have to kill each other. What do you say?Joker:...No. I'm sorry, but...No. It's too late for that. Far too late. Hahaha. Y'know, it's funny...this situation. It reminds me of a joke.See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum...and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape. So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight...stretching away to freedom.Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend daredn't make the leap. Y'see...y'see, he's afraid of falling. So the first guy gets an idea. He says, ""Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!""B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says...he says ""What do you think I am? Crazy?""""You'd turn it off when I was half way across!""",0.132,0.765,0.102,-0.9853

As I Lay Dying,Metal,Metalcore,As I Lay Dying - section 40,"Addie In the afternoon when school was out and the last one had left with his little dirty snuffling nose, instead of going home I would go down the hill to the spring where I could be quiet and hate them. It would he quiet there then, with the water bubbling up and away and the sun slanting quiet in the trees and the quiet smelling of damp and rotting leaves and new earth; especially in the early spring, for it was worst then.I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time And when I would have to look at them day after day, ""each with his and her secret and selfish thought, and blood strange to each other blood and strange to mine, and think that this seemed to be the only way I could get ready to stay dead, I would hate my father for having ever planted me. I would look forward to the times when they faulted, so I could whip them. When the switch fell I could feel it upon my flesh; when it welted and ridged it was my blood that ran, and I would think with each blow of the switch: Now you are aware of me Now I am something in your secret and selfish life, who have marked your blood with my own for ever and ever.And so I took Anse. I saw him pass the school house three or four times before I learned that he was driving four miles out of his way to do it. I noticed then how he was beginning to hump--a tall man and young --so that he looked already like a tall bird hunched in the cold weather, on the wagon seat He would pass the school house, the wagon creaking slow, his head turning slow to watch the door of the school house as the wagon passed, until he went on around the curve and out of sight. One day I went to the door and stood there when he passed. When he saw me he looked quickly away and did not look backagain.In the early spring it was worst. Sometimes I thought that I could not bear it, lying in bed at night, with the wild geese going north and their honking coming faint and high and wild out of the wild darkness, and during the day it would seem as though I couldn't wait for the last one to go so I could go down to the spring. And so when I looked up that day and saw Anse standing there in his Sunday clothes, turning his hat round and round in his hands, I said:""If you've got any womenfolks, why in the world dont they make you get your hair cut?""""I aint got none,"" he said. Then he said suddenly, driving his eyes at me like two hounds in a strange yard: ""That's what I come to see you about,""""And make you hold your shoulders up,"" I said. ""You haven't got any? But you've got a house. They tell me you've got a house and a good farm. And you live there alone, doing for yourself, do you?"" He just looked at me, turning the hat in his hands. ""A new house,"" I said. ""Are you going to get married?""And he said again, holding his eyes to mine: ""That's what I come to see you about.""Later he told me, ""I aint got no people. So that wont be no worry to you. I dont reckon you can say the same.""""No. I have people. In Jefferson.""His face fell a little. ""Well, I got a little property. I'm forehanded; I got a good honest name. I know how town folks are, but maybe when they talk to me . . .""""They might listen,"" I said. ""But they'll be hard to talk to."" He was watching my face. ""They're in the cemetery.""""But your living kin,"" he said. ""They'll be different.""""Will they?"" I said. 'I dont know. I never had any other kind.”So I took Anse. And when I knew that I had Cash, I knew that living was terrible and that this was the answer to it. That was when I learned that words are no good; that words dont ever fit even what they are trying to say at. When he was born I knew that motherhood was invented by someone who had to have a word for it because the ones that had the children didn't care whether there was a word for it or not. I knew that fear was invented by someone that had never had the fear; pride, who never had the pride. I knew that it had been, not that they had dirty noses, but that we had had to use one another by words like spiders dangling by their mouths from a beam, swinging and twisting and never touching, and that only through the blows of die switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream. I knew that it had. been, not that my aloneness had to be violated over and over each day, but that it had never been violated until Cash came. Not even by Anse in the nights.He had a word, too. Love, he called it. But I had been used to words for a long time. I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack; that when the right time Came, you wouldn't need a word for that anymore than for pride or fear. Cash did not need to say it to me nor I to him, and I would say Let Anse use it, if he wants to. So that it was Anse or love; love or Anse: it didn't matter.I would think that even while I lay with him in the dark and Cash asleep in the cradle within the swing of my hand. I would think that if he were to wake and cry, I would suckle him, too. Anse or love: it .didn't matter. My aloneness had been violated and then made whole again by the violation: time, Anse, love, what you will, outside the circle.Then I found that I had Darl. At first I would not believe it. Then I believed that I would kill Anse. It was as though he had tricked me, hidden within a word like within a paper screen and struck me in the back through it. But then I realised that I had been tricked by words older than Anse or love, and that the same word had tricked Anse too, and that my revenge would be that he would never know I was taking revenge. And when Darl was born I asked Anse to promise to take me back to Jefferson when I died, because I knew that father had been right, even when he couldn't have known he was right anymore than I could have known I was wrong.""Nonsense,"" Anse said; ""you and me aint nigh done chapping yet, with just two.""He did not know that he was dead, then. Sometimes I would lie by him in the dark, hearing the land that was now of my blood and flesh, and I would think: Anse. Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without Me like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgotten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a               and I couldn't think Anse, couldn't remember Anse. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now. And when I would think Cash and Darl that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what they call them.And so when Cora Tull would tell me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin, line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other and that sin and love and fear are-just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who could never even cook.She would tell me what I owed to my children and to Anse and to God. I gave Anse the children. I did not ask for them. I did not even ask him for what he could have given me: not-Anse. That was my duty to him, to not ask that, and that duty I fulfilled. I would be I; I would let him be the shape and echo of his word. That was more than he asked, because he could not have asked for that and been Anse, using himself so with a word.And then he died. He did not know he was dead. I would lie by him in the dark, hearing the dark land talking of Cod's love and His beauty and His sin; hearing the dark voicelessness in which the words are the deeds, and the other words that are not deeds, that are just the gaps in peoples' lacks, coming down like the cries of the geese out of the wild darkness in the old terrible nights, fumbling at the deeds like orphans to whom are pointed out in a crowd two faces and told, That is your father, your mother.I believed that I had found it. I believed that the reason was the duty to the alive, to the terrible blood, the red bitter flood boiling through the land. I would think of sin as I would think of the clothes we both wore in the world's face, of the circumspection necessary because he was he and I was I; the sin the more utter and terrible since he was the instrument ordained by God who created the sin, to sanctify that sin He had created. While I waited for him in the woods, waiting for him before he saw me, I would think of him as dressed in sin. I would think of him as thinking of me as dressed also in sin, he the more beautiful since the garment which he had exchanged for sin was sanctified. I would think of the sin as garments which we would remove in order to shape and coerce the terrible blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air. Then I would lay with Anse again--I did not lie to him: I just refused, just as I refused my breast to Cash, and Darl after their time was up--hearing the dark land talking the voiceless speech.I hid nothing. I tried to deceive no one. I would not have cared. I merely took the precautions that he thought necessary for his sake, not for my safety, but just as I wore clothes in the world's face. And I would think then when Cora talked to me, of how the high dead words in time seemed to lose even the significance of their dead sound.Then it was over. Over in the sense that he was gone and I knew that, see him again though I would, I would never again see him coming swift and secret to me in the woods dressed in sin like a gallant garment already blowing aside with the speed of his secret coming.But for me it was not over. I mean, over in the sense of beginning and ending, because to me there was no beginning nor ending to anything then. I even held Anse refraining still, not that I was holding him recessional, but as though nothing else had ever been. My children were of me alone, of the wild blood boiling along the earth, of me and of all that lived; of none and of all. Then I found that I had Jewel. When I waked to remember to discover it, he was two months gone.My father said that the reason for living is getting ready to stay dead. I knew at last what he meant and that he could not have known what he meant himself, because a man cannot know anything about cleaning up the house afterward. And so I have cleaned my house. With Jewel--I lay by the lamp, holding up my own head, watching him cap and suture it before he breathed—the wild blood boiled away and the sound of it ceased. Then there was only the milk, warm and calm, and I lying calm in the slow silence, getting ready to clean my house.I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negative Jewel. Then I gave him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of. And now he has three children that are his and not mine. And then I could get ready to die.One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, to them salvation is just words too.",0.117,0.79,0.093,-0.9968

Epica,Metal,Symphonic Metal,Making of ‘Cry for the Moon’,"This is the pre-production for ""Cry for the Moon"", as we recorded it at my place before entering the Excess Studio to record it as a demo track As you can hear, it contains drums (which I then played on my synthesizer), guitars and synthesizer, and this last one has a funny story to it Since we only had two days in the studio, we wanted to use all the time we had as efficient as possible, so we came up with the idea of recording all the synthesizer tracks as MIDI tracks on my computer before entering the studio, so we would only have to transfer that to the recording computer at the studio Okay now, here's the funny thing. Due to some exams, I wasn't able to be present during the mixing process, so when transferring these tracks to the studio recording computer, Coen and Mark, they thought it would be better if they used Mark's synthesizer for that, probably because it had more keys, but this means that all the work I had with editing, programming and finding the right sounds was just useless, because all the tracks were edited specifically to the sounds on my synthesizer and, well, not to Mark's.
